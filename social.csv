1,Social,1B+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy of the application fails to meet key GDPR principles making it a bad standard policy. Specifically, the policy doesn’t clearly articulate the legal basis for data processing as required by the principle of lawfulness. It also falls short on the principle of transparency as it fails to provide clear, specific information on how the user's data is processed. For instance, it mentions sharing data with several third parties but does not clarify the nature of the data involved, the conditions under which it's shared, or who these third parties are. The policy is not transparent about how advertisers and third-party partners may collect and use personal data. Lastly, the policy doesn’t indicate ways in which users can control, update or delete their data, hence violating the principles of accuracy and storage limitation."
2,Social,1K+,Good Standard,"The Privacy Policy has provided a clear explanation about how customers' information is gathered and used. There's a statement that they are not using or sharing information besides what is mentioned in the Privacy Policy which indicates transparency and lawfulness. A clear list of third-party service providers and the security measures were also mentioned which suggests they value data integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, they provide a way for users to reject cookies, ensuring user consent. Lastly, the policy addresses changes to the policy and provides a contact for questions or concerns which also indicates transparency. However, it falls short on some points, such as it doesn't clearly provide the exact purpose limitation, data minimization and it doesn't ensure the accuracy of data."
3,Social,1K+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy is considered of bad standard due to several reasons:
1) The policy does not specify the exact purpose for data collection (purpose limitation principle).
2) The policy mentions that personal data may be shared with third parties, but it does not clearly state the basis for this sharing, whether user consent is obtained, and how these third parties are managing user data (transparency, lawfulness, fairness principles).
3) The policy leaves the responsibility of reviewing the privacy policies of external third-party sites or services to the user, instead of providing a brief overview or a guarantee of these third-party services' compliance with data protection standards (transparency, lawfulness principles).
4) The policy does not demonstrate any mechanisms to ensure data accuracy and allows the user to update their information (accuracy principle).
5) The policy does not specify the time period for which the data will be stored (storage limitation principle).
6) Although it mentions attempts at protecting personal data, the policy acknowledges that no storage method is 100% secure, which raises concerns about data integrity and confidentiality (integrity and confidentiality principles).
7) The app can use third party services that may collect information used to identify users without clearly stating the necessity or purposes of this practice (data minimization principle).
Due to above points, this policy does not fully adhere to the GDPR Article 5 principles."
4,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy document violates many of the GDPR principles and therefore would be classified under bad standard.
1. It lacks transparency and clarity especially in the sections discussing the disclosure of personal information for marketing and advertising (IV. How We Use and Disclose the Information We Collect). It is not explicitly stated whether the user's consent is sought before sharing the information for marketing and advertising which violates the lawfulness and fairness principles.
2. The document fails to assure the user of the accuracy of their data (III. Information We Collect). The process of updating or rectifying inaccurate data is not discussed adequately.
3. While there is mention of the right to delete"
5,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy does fail to fully meet the principles of Good Privacy Standards. The reasons are:
1. Purpose Limitation: Even though the company explained how it intends to use collected data, it fails in defining the explicit purposes for the collection of each specific data category.
2. Data Minimization: The policy does not make clear whether data collected is least necessary or whether it's beyond the scope of the initially described purposes.
3. Storage Limitation: The company doesn't specify a limit to the retention of user data. There's no detailed explanation regarding the period of data storage or conditions for the deletion of data when it's no longer necessary.
4. Security: Although the company mentions that the privacy of the user's data is paramount, there are no indications of measures to ensure data security and steps to tackle data breaches.
5. Consent: The policy assumes consent by virtue of using the application. Clear opt-in consent should be provided in compliance with lawfulness, where the users actively acknowledge that they understand and agree with the policies.
6. Transparency: The policy shares collected personal data with third parties, but it doesn't expressly want us about these parties or the individual's right to oppose such sharing.
7. Accuracy: The policy does not provide a way for the individual to rectify or update their information by themselves."
6,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy document provided by dharmann.com displays adherence to GDPR principles which validates it as a Good Standard.
1. Lawfulness, Fairness & Transparency: The policy clearly defines personal data and states when and why it is collected. Legal basis for processing data is outlined and the policy is clear and easy to understand.
2. Purpose Limitation: The policy specifies its purposes for data collection, including order processing, providing improved customer experience, and legal obligation compliance.
3. Data Minimization: The policy collects only the necessary data for completing transactions, such as name, email address, shipping address, and payment information.
4. Accuracy: The policy offers the opportunity for users to request an exported file of personal data held by the site to ensure information accuracy.
5. Storage Limitation: Retention period is defined, stating the data will be processed only for the period necessary to achieve its purposes.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: The policy emphasizes security measures implemented to protect data against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. It also discusses how users can control their personal data.
In conclusion, although the policy can further improve in explicitly stating how long it retains personal data or the steps for data rectification, it satisfies the majority of GDPR principles and is thus categorized as of Good Standard."
7,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"Upon review, it is clear that the main issues that prevent InterPals' privacy policy from reaching Good Standard are rooted in lack of transparency and questionable practices concerning data handling.
Firstly, the policy does not clearly specify the exact purposes for data collection or where this data may be used outside of these purposes (lack of purpose limitation). The policy merely alludes to collecting data for general purposes, service improvement, assisting users, information sharing with business partners and for advertising. There is also evidence of unnecessary data collection, such as obtaining information about users’ transactions with InterPals’ business partners, which exceeds what is needed for the stated purposes (violating data minimization principles).
Secondly, the policy fails to explicitly define the legal basis for data processing. It also mentions sharing personally identifiable information with business partners or others, which can be potentially problematic if not properly monitored or controlled for user interest.
Further, the policy does not provide clear indications about the retention period for user data, implying potential indefinite storage of data — a direct violation of the storage limitation principle.
Finally, user data is shared for advertising purposes and with companies that users have not explicitly agreed to share information with, which could be interpreted as a lack of fairness in data handling.
Overall, these lapses in expected conduct, as per GDPR Article 5 principles, place InterPals’ privacy policy in the category of Bad Standards."
8,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The reasons are as follows:
1. The policy does not specify the exact purposes for data collection. It does not demonstrate data minimization and the collection of only necessary data for the stated purposes. For example, location data is collected by default even if a user opts not to display it to others, and it is not clear why such location data is necessary for their services.
2. The policy does not provide clear, accessible information that is easy for the average user to understand. The legal basis for processing data is not clearly stated, and the policy is vague about how stored personal data is used, such as stating information will be used ""to meet applicable legal requirements"" or for ""legitimate business interests"".
3. The policy does not adequately address storage limitation, as it does not clearly indicate the time period for which personal data will be stored and the criteria used to determine this duration. It states that data will be stored for as long ""as necessary"", which is vague and could allow for indefinite data retention.
4. The policy indicates that personal data, such as chats or postings, may be accessed by third parties for various purposes. There seems to be a lack of robust measures to protect data from unauthorized access.
5. The policy suggests that personal data may be shared with third party advertisers for the purposes of delivering relevant advertisements or content, which could indicate a failure to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
Consequently, owing to these reasons, the privacy policy does not align with Good Privacy Policy Standards. It presents several non-compliance and poor practices issues in relation to GDPR Article 5 principles, thereby classifying it as a Bad Standard."
9,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The reasons are as follow:
1. The policy lacks transparency because it does not clearly explain how TikFamous uses the collected data. It broadly states that IP addresses, browser types, ISPs, timestamps, referring/exit pages, and click numbers are collected for ""analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement, and gathering demographic information"". It is vague and inexplicit and does not make it understandable for the average user.
2. The policy fails to specify any legal basis for processing data. It simply states that by using TikFamous, users consent to their privacy policy. These conditions are not clearly elaborated or explained.
3. The document does not mention any mechanisms for ensuring the accuracy of data or allowing users to easily rectify or update their information, which does not meet the GDPR accuracy standard.
4. There is also no information about how long the data will be stored, violating the storage limitation principle.
5. Lastly, the policy does not outline what measures or safeguards are in place to protect users' data, indicating a lack of data integrity and confidentiality."
10,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy contains clauses that adhere to the principles of lawfulness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality. Specifically, the policy requires the consent of users to process their data and clearly states the legal basis for processing (posing as a legal agreement between users and the company). It is transparent about how the data is collected used, shared, and stored, providing clear, accessible information that is easy for the average user to understand. It specifies the exact purposes for data collection and asserts that this data will not be further processed in a different manner. The privacy policy demonstrates the practice of data minimization by requesting only relevant information from users. It ensures the integrity and confidentiality of users' data achieved by employing standard security measures, including password hashing and the use of an encrypted connection. It also makes provision for dispute resolution and for dealing with user enquiries, which shows a commitment to upholding the rights and interests of the users. Lastly, it provides users with the option to modify their information and even to request complete deletion of their data. This couples with the practice of data retention minimization where details about the said retention are shared upfront. While the entire document seems to be filled with jargons and some parts may not as accessible for a layperson, the policy primarily aligns with the defined good standard."
11,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy of BeFriend Inc. fails to meet several key GDPR principles. While the policy clearly states what information is collected, it does not provide a clear legal basis for doing so. It collects excessive information without justifying whether all of it is necessary for functioning of services, hence violating data minimization. It does not provide clear, accessible information on how users can rectify or update their data, breaching the accuracy principle. While it does mention storage limitation, it fails to provide a specific time frame for data retention. It mentions sharing information with business partners and third parties but does not provide transparent information about the entities with whom the data is shared. Lastly, the security measures implemented to protect the data are not mentioned, undermining the principles of integrity and confidentiality. Furthermore, despite changes to the policy, the policy does not explicitly detail a user's rights under GDPR or how to exercise them. |"
12,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy falls short of the following good privacy policy standards:
1. Lawfulness: The policy does not clearly state the legal basis for processing data, other than a generic statement about using information in accordance with the privacy statement.
2. Transparency: While there is some degree of transparency about the data collected, the policy is vague about how exactly this data is used and for what specific purposes.
3. Data Minimization: The policy fails to demonstrate data minimization, listing several types of data the service collects such as 'demographic information', 'device information', 'account information' and even 'microphone and camera permission', which might not be necessary for the stated purposes.
4. Purpose Limitation: Although the policy mentions reasons for collecting data, none of these reasons are specified or explicit, leaving room for further processing in manners that might be incompatible with original purposes.
5. Integrity and Confidentiality: The policy does not provide specifics on the security measures implemented to protect data, merely stating that they have ""put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures"".
6. Storage Limitation: The privacy policy does not mention a specific retention period for the data collected.
7. Fairness: The policy states that user information can be provided to third party partners for marketing or promotional purposes potentially without explicit user consent.
8. Accuracy: There is no mention of any mechanisms in place to ensure that collected data remains accurate and up to date."
13,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy document of Bunch Live, Inc. is of a good standard. It explains how user data is collected, used, and shared. It also provides information on how the users can manage and delete their personal data. The policy documents also state they are in adherence with the law and have a legal basis for data processing. The transparency and choice regarding third-party tracking and behavioural advertising, as well as how to opt out are commendable. The policy also covers data retention schedules, data security measures to protect user data, and adjustments made to accommodate child users (Children's Information section) in alignment with GDPR principles. Furthermore, in case of changes in privacy policy, notifications as required by law are promised. Also, the contact information required to exercise user rights or to ask any questions regarding privacy practices is clearly provided at the end."
14,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy fulfills the GDPR Article 5 principles.
1. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: The policy clearly defines what ""personal information"" is and details the types of information that will be collected, directly or through third parties, such as shipping and billing information, IP addresses, geolocation data, device types, etc. It also specifies under what conditions certain categories of personal information will be collected, ensuring consent and transparency (sections: ""Information We Collect"", ""Sources of Personal Information"").
2. Purpose limitation: The policy lists specific reasons for collecting personal information including transactional purposes, analytical purposes, marketing purposes, maintenance and improvement of services, and security and fraud prevention, ensuring data is not used beyond these defined purposes (section: ""Categories of Use"").
3. Data minimization: The policy mentions collecting information that is necessary for its services, for instance, device type is collected to send notifications; geolocation for tagging posts; browsing and click history are collected but in an anonymized form (section: ""Information We Collect"").
4. Accuracy: Although the policy does not address the ability for users to update or rectify their information directly, it maintains accuracy by updating user information whenever they opt into certain features or share their data from third-parties (section: ""Sources of Personal Information"").
5. Storage limitation: While the policy doesn't mention the exact duration of storage for each type of data, it does clarify that certain data like the Information shown under the “Usage Info” feature is stored locally on user's own device or on iCloud, and does not plan to store indefinitely (section: ""Sources of Personal Information"").
6. Integrity and confidentiality: The policy explains the use of data for security purposes and fraud detection, implying measures to protect the data. The company collects data for security purposes but is explicit about it's limited use for security only, ensuring integrity and confidentiality (section: ""Information We Collect"").
The policy also mentions that users may opt out of receiving marketing messages, giving them a degree of control over their personal information (section: ""Marketing Purposes"")."
15,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of the ""Audio Status Maker"" application demonstrates good standard privacy policy principles in the following ways:
1. Lawfulness: The application clearly states that it may collect various types of user information, including information related to the user's device and usage pattern. This information is automatically collected and used for legitimate purposes, such as to improve the application's functionality and user experience.
2. Fairness: The policy assures that user-generated content, including all form of audio recordings, remains solely on the user's device and is shared only at their discretion.
3. Transparency: The policy clearly states that it may disclose user information to third parties as outlined in the privacy statement, including legal purposes, fraud investigation, or due to business transitions like mergers or acquisitions.
4. Purpose Limitation: The application's primary purpose of data collection (improving app functionality and user experience) is explicitly described.
5. Data Minimization: The application does not collect precise location information or content generated by the users, indicating that it collects only what is necessary.
6. Accuracy: It provides opportunities for users to opt-out of information collection or request deletion of their data by contacting them at a given email address.
7. Storage Limitation: The policy mentions that user-provided data will be retained for as long as the user uses the app and automatically collected data will be stored for up to 24 months.
8. Integrity and Confidentiality: The privacy policy mentions several precautions taken to safeguard the data and confidentiality of the users but warns that no system is perfect.
However, even though it mostly aligns with the GDPR principles, the policy could be more explicit about what steps the user can take to correct inaccurate information. It could also detail more precise measures it uses to safeguard user data."
16,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The Mastodon for Android app clearly states that it does not collect or process any personal data from its users, adhering to the principle of data minimization. However, it provides additional transparency by informing users about third-party servers and their individual privacy policies, adhering to the principle of transparency. The policy is straightforward and understandable to an average person, meeting the requirements of the lawfulness, fairness, transparency and data minimization principles. Although it could provide more details particularly related to data storage, handling, and security measures, these sections might not be necessary as the app itself does not collect any data."
17,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy contains elements that demonstrate a good standard of adherence to the GDPR principles. Specific sections justifying this rating include:
1. ""1.3. This Rules are worked out with the purpose of providing proper protection of the personal data of Users, other information about Users, from an unauthorized division and disclosure"": This statement upholds the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in data processing activities.
2. ""3.1. Processing of the Personal Data is done by such principles"": This section demonstrates a commitment to purpose limitation, data minimization, storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality.
3. ""3.5. The company reserves the right to give the User’s personal data to the third parties in the following cases"": Although this section gives the company the right to share data, it lays out specific conditions for when this can be done, hence upholding the principle of fairness.
4. ""3.6. The Company provides the reasonable mode of confidentiality of the personal data of User"": This shows a clear commitment to data security, adhering to the principle of integrity and confidentiality.
5. ""4.1. The User can change (update, add) the given information or its part any time"": This statement upholds the principle of accuracy, ensuring that users can correct or update their data at any time.
6. ""6.4. All correspondence, received by the Company from the User..., belongs to the information of limited access and is not disclosed without written consent of the User"": This statement ensures the integrity and confidentiality of users' data.
However, some elements could be better articulated for full compliance, such as the specific duration of data retention (storage limitation principle) and clear definitions of what constitutes 'necessary' data for collection (data minimization principle). The explicit mention of the user's right to retract consent would also be beneficial."
18,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of WhatzDirect demonstrates characteristics of good standard privacy policies. Firstly, it identifies the legal basis for data processing activities, such as consent, performance of a contract, and compliance with the law, abiding by the principle of lawfulness (GDPR paragraph). Further, it extends data retention only for as long as necessary, demonstrating commitment toward storage limitation. The policy also highlights the rights of the user, including the right to delete, update, or access their information, ensuring transparency and promoting fairness. The policy also shows evidence of data minimization as it claims not to log any user information beyond necessary details. Although it uses third-party advertising partners, users are explicitly informed about it and are given options to opt-out or personalize their preferences, reinforcing transparency and fairness once again. Lastly, children's data protection is also taken into account by explicitly mentioning proper measures taken to protect personal identifiable information of children under the age of 13."
19,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy presented meets the good standard criteria due to the following reasons:
1) Lawfulness and fairness are shown through the explicit statement that user data will not be sold or transferred to third parties without user consent (principle of lawfulness), as well as that the app will retain user information only as long as necessary or until the user requests its deletion (principle of fairness).
2) Transparency is demonstrated by outlining what types of data are collected (such as IP address and cookies), how these data are used, and by providing an easy opt-out process.
3) Purpose Limitation is satisfied with the clear statement of how the data that has been collected will be used.
4) The principle of data minimization is respected as the app collects only necessary data.
5) The principle of accuracy is met through the policy of protecting electronic communications as they do with other pieces of collected information.
6) Storage limitation is shown in the GDPR rights section where it states that data will be stored until the user requests its deletion.
7) Lastly, the principles of integrity and confidentiality are maintained by stating the usage of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure data transmission and having specific software to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts at modifying data and ensuring its security.
Overall, the policy is easy to understand, clear, and covers all aspects required to meet good privacy policy standards."
20,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy fails to provide clear, specific details on various important aspects. Firstly, it does not specify the legal basis for data processing. While it does mention that data is collected for improving the app and providing service, it does not clearly specify other purposes. Secondly, it does not assure the accuracy and updating of data. Consequently, individuals may not have the ability to ensure their data is current and correct. Furthermore, the policy allows the sharing of user data with other sites on the network without explicitly indicating user consent. Lastly, the policy lacks transparency when it comes to data storage, failing to mention the duration for which personal data will be maintained or criteria used to determine this period."
21,Social,1M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy lacks transparency and lawfulness. It does not specify the grounds for processing personal data or the kind of personal data it collects. Furthermore, it does not inform users about their rights, and there's a lack of clear instructions on how users can update, rectify or delete their personal data. In addition, information about data minimization is missing - the policy doesn't specify what data is necessary for the service. Also, there's no clear statement regarding data security measures. Finally, there's no mention of third-party data sharing or if the data is transferred internationally. Overall, the policy doesn't fulfil many GDPR Article 5 principles."
22,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of C4 Chat shows a commitment to the key principles outlined in the GDPR. Firstly, it satisfies the principle of lawfulness, with the consent of the users' data clearly obtained as they use the Service. Fairness is demonstrated with their clarity on how user data is processed and the option to opt-in or out of specific programs. The policy is transparent as it gives detailed information on data collection, use, and sharing. It also adheres to purpose limitation by outlining specific purposes for data collection such as improving site features. Data minimization is proven as the data collected is only what is necessary for their operations. The accuracy of data is somewhat achieved as users have an option to rectify their status. They express an intent to retain billing data for 30 days after the termination of an account, supporting the principle of storage limitation. Lastly, it mentions utilizing measures to ensure the security of personal data which adheres to the principles of integrity and confidentiality. However, more details about these measures would bolster the policy. Finally, the commitment to not knowingly collect data from minors asserts an emphasis on the priority given to the welfare of individuals. Overall, while there may be areas for further clarity, the privacy policy appears to hold good standard according to the GDPR definitions."
23,Social,1M+,Good Standard,"This privacy Policy is generally in line with GPDR standards. It provides a degree of transparency in explaining how data is collected, used, and shared (sections 4,5, and 11). It shows an effort in data minimization as data collection is tied to service provision (section 5). There is also an aspect of storage limitation as they state the data are used for statistical purposes only (section 8). Additionally, they ensure confidentiality by explaining their use of cookies for data protection (section 7 and 8). Despite not expressing it directly, they infer the requirement of user consent for certain data processing activities (section 11) underlining lawfulness. However, the specific timeframe for data storage should be clearly defined, as well as a more explicit regard for correction of inaccurate data. Even so, the policy generally adheres to GDPR principles, thus can be considered 'Good'."
24,Social,5M+,Bad Standard,"Although the privacy policy document is generally detailed and contains specific sections about data usage, it fails to clearly define all the key principles of the GDPR Article 5. Specifically, the policy:
1) Does not establish a clear ""purpose limitation"", i.e., considering each individual piece of collected information, defining the specific, explicit, and legitimate purpose for its collection;
2) It does not address the principles of data minimization and accuracy, i.e., it doesn't ensure that only essential data is collected and that the data is kept accurate, up-to-date, and rectified if needed;
3) There are no clear provisions for user rights such as data deletion procedures and timelines;
4) Although it does emphasize non-retention of payment information, it does not describe comprehensive security measures to guard against unauthorized access, data loss, and destruction.
All the information is presented in a descriptive manner that might be difficult for the average user to understand. Transparency could be improved with better language and structure (section categorization and easier access to key points)."
25,Social,5M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy does not meet the ""Good Standard"" criteria due to several reasons. Although they do indicate users have the ability to control certain aspects of their data, the language used is not as clear and understandable as it should be, hinting a lack of transparency. Moreover, the policy does not specifically articulate the legal basis for processing data. Also, it states that information, including geographic location and other personal details, can be shared with other users and third-party service providers, which might be concerning for users. The policy also does not explicitly outline how they ensure the accuracy of the data collected and does not adequately detail the security measures taken to protect user data. Additionally, the policy contains a clause about potentially sharing data in case of mergers or acquisitions, which could be considered beyond the scope of the original purpose of data collection."
26,Social,5M+,Bad Standard,"Given that the privacy policy is entirely in Japanese, the fundamental principle of transparency is violated, as it fails to be clear, accessible, and particularly understandable for non-Japanese speaking users. In addition, while the document discloses the data gathering process, it is not explicitly clear if they obtain user consent before collecting and processing sensitive data, which may affect users' rights and freedoms.
Finally, there is an alarming degree of data acquired (names, phone numbers, advertising ID, device information, and payment data, among others), which may exceed what is necessary for its stated purposes, hence violates the data minimization principle. There's also no clear information about how long this data is retained, violating the storage limitation principle.
While the policy mentions some measures for ensuring data is not shared with third parties and is only used for intended purposes, it lacks details about the steps taken to ensure data accuracy and security measures to protect this extensive personal data. This lack of detail could potentially violate the integrity and confidentiality principles."
27,Social,5M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy in question shows a lack of adherence towards the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under GDPR. Particularly, the document lacks clear legal basis for data processing or fair specification of the same. The policy uses vague language and is non-transparent about the handling of personal data. It discloses user information to third parties without explaining if explicit user consent is obtained. It also mentions several times that even when users decided to make certain privacy details non-public, unauthorized or sophisticated users might still be able to obtain that information, this suggests lack of necessary protective security. Additionally, under the principle of data minimization, the policy seems to support excessive collection of data with respect to user profiles, user submissions, and geographic location, without clearly stating its necessity for the stated purpose. There is also no clear mention of the period for which data will be stored, violating the storage limitation principle. Furthermore, lack of emphasis on accuracy of data, no detailed procedures on rectification of inaccurate data and robust security measures, result in significant deficiencies in the privacy policy. |"
28,Social,5M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy largely meets the principles outlined for a good standard. Specific sections that showcase these include:
1. ""Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency"" - The policy stipulates a legal basis for processing data (user's consent). It is also transparent about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data: ""This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data""
2. ""Purpose Limitation"" - The purpose for data collection is clearly specified: ""We only collect information for analytical purposes to provide and improve our Service to you"".
3. ""Data Minimization"" - Minimal data is collected for the specified purpose of service analysis and improvement.
4. ""Accuracy"" - It does not directly mention this, but the minimized data collection implies there is less chance for inaccuracies.
5. ""Storage Limitation"" - The policy states that no user private data is retained and local data used by the app is deleted when the app is uninstalled, implying adherence to storage limitation principle.
6. ""Integrity and Confidentiality"" - The policy shows intent to protect user data (""The security of your data is important to us"") and, while it acknowledges not all transmissions over the internet are completely secure, it strives for commercially acceptable standards of data security.
The policy could be more explicit about data accuracy measures and data breach response protocols. But overall, it demonstrates good privacy policy standards."
29,Social,5M+,Bad Standard,"The provided content does not contain information about any of the essential elements of a privacy policy under GDPR Article 5 principles. There are no sections detailing legal basis, data processing activities, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, or data security measures."
30,Social,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Paltalk covers all the necessary GDPR Article 5 principles. It provides transparency about data collection, specifically listing all kinds of data they collect. This reflects principles of lawfulness and fairness. Moreover, the policy explains the purpose of data collection, the method of information processing, and the third parties with whom the data is shared, adhering to principles of purpose limitation and ensuring transparency. The policy also addresses data minimization, pointing out that it only gathers information necessary for providing their services. It has a policy of ensuring data accuracy, encouraging users to update their information, and it also details the storage limitation, noting that data is kept on AWS secure servers, meeting principles of integrity, confidentiality and storage limitation. Users' rights to control their data, including correction, erasure, and restriction of processing, are also mentioned, which meet the GDPR standards for a privacy policy."
31,Social,5M+,Good Standard,"This policy is generally good as it illustrates many principles stated in the GDPR Article 5 principles. Namely, it specifies a lawful basis for the data collection (user consent) and details how it collects, uses, transfers and stores data, demonstrating fairness, transparency and lawfulness. It indicates the types of personal data collected and its specific purposes, satisfying the requirement of purpose limitation. It includes provisions for data transfer and security, acknowledging the steps taken to secure data and handle breaches. The policy also allows for the possibility of third-party involvement, but ensures that these third parties only have access to personal data for specific tasks and cannot use it for other purposes. However, the policy can be improved by specifically mentioning how they assure the accuracy of data and the definite time period for data storage, as well as the process involved if a data breach occurs."
32,Social,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy highlights their adherence to the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. It states the legal basis for processing data (user consent or the performance of a contract), explains the data types collected, and details how the data is used. Furthermore, the policy outlines its purpose limitation, stating that data will not be used in a manner incompatible with the specified purposes. In line with the principle of data minimization, the policy collects only necessary data. The policy has strong provisions for the accuracy of personal data, including mechanisms to rectify inaccuracies, and highlights the storage limitation by revealing the set period for data storage. The policy adheres to the principle of confidentiality and integrity, detailing the security measures in place to protect data. Additionally, the policy enforces data subject rights, including the right to access and deletion of data held by the company. It also addresses the compliant age limit for data collection. Lastly, the policy explicitly names the data controller, providing contact details for the individual responsible for overseeing the company's data protection strategy and ensuring compliance with GDPR rules."
33,Social,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy has detailed descriptions on how it collects, stores, and uses user data. It gives reasons on all its data processing activities maintaining the principle of lawfulness, eg. lines like 'We adopt the data minimization principle when collecting and using your data and ensure that your data will only be used in accordance with the stated purposes below.' which confirms data minimization. The policy discloses that it shares data with third parties for legal obligations and business purposes which is a fulfillment of the transparency principle. The collected data is used for the stated purposes only thus staying true to purpose limitation. The policy allows users to access, control and modify their data, embodying the principle of accuracy. The policy details provisions in place to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality (Section 11). It discloses all third-party data sharing conducting the activity in a lawful manner. Upon request, it promises the deletion of users' personally identifiable data from their servers and provides procedures for users to withdraw consent or object to data processing, resonating with the principle of storage limitation. Overall, it covers all the principles and values of GDPR Article 5 and maintains good privacy policy standards."
34,Social,5M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy does not provide specific details regarding the data collection, use, and storage.

There is also no mention of security measures to ensure data integrity and confidentiality."
35,Social,5M+,Bad Standard,"The provided document is not a privacy policy; it doesn't mention any information about the collection, use, sharing, storage, and protection of personal data. Therefore, it cannot be classified according to the Good or Bad privacy policy standards derived from the GDPR Article 5 principles."
36,Social,5M+,Good Standard,"The chatgum privacy policy shows good privacy standards aligned well with GDPR Article 5 principles. The policy clarifies the reasons for data collection as to improve its services and administer user usage (Principle of Purpose Limitation). It identifies the types of data to be collected ensuring data minimization. The policy communicates explicitly about how the data is processed, shared, and the purposes of such actions, indicating transparency. It also provides a manner for users to access, rectify, or delete their information (Principle of Accuracy). The document outlines measures taken to ensure data security (Principle of Confidentiality) and the time period for data retention (Principle of Storage Limitation). The privacy policy also speaks about compliance with legal requirements, reasonable necessity for data processing (Principle of Lawfulness), and adherence to the principles of rights of the data subject as described in GDPR, including the right of confirmation, right of access, right to rectify, right to erasure, right of restriction of processing, right to portability, right to object, and right to withdraw data protection consent."

The policy provides a clear and detailed explanation of the particulars of how user data is collected, used, and shared (Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc). The policy also clearly states the basis for processing data, including the consent of users and the tasks carried out by application for the performance of the service (Sections 1.1, 1.2, etc.). The policy also takes respect of data minimization principle as it outlines specifics about what data is relevant and necessary for the app to function properly (Sections 1.3, 2.3, etc.). The policy also showcases strong commitment to the security of user data (Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, etc.) and it clearly establishes constraints on how long user data should be kept (Section 4.2). The policy unequivocally mentions the rights of the users concerning their data, offering control over their own data by providing tools and settings to manage their privacy (Sections 4.1, 4.2, etc.). It should be noted, however, the policy could be improved by providing more specific details on third party sharing details (Section 3.1). Still, overall, this privacy policy meets the standards of a good privacy policy."
38,Social,10M+,Bad Standard,"This privacy policy document does not adhere to the good privacy policy standards defined under GDPR Article 5 principles. It lacks transparency as there is no clear information on how the application, Monkey, is processing the data and what kind of data it is processing. There is no mention of the legal basis for processing user data, how this data is collected, used, shared, or stored, and for what purposes. There are also no details on the duration of data storage and the steps taken to maintain data accuracy and security. The document does not provide concrete information about the users' rights in relation to their data or how the app ensures data minimization, indicating non-compliance to GDPR. Instead, the document focuses on describing the application rather than protecting users' data rights."
39,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by the Pinger application appears to meet the criteria for Good Privacy Policy Standards. Here are the reasons why:
- Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: The policy clearly states the legal basis for processing data, which is to provide and improve their products and services. They also specify that they do not intentionally collect data from children under the age of 13, meeting the fairness principle.
- Purpose Limitation: The data collected by Pinger has a specified purpose, which is primarily to enhance the user's experience of their services.
- Data Minimization: Pinger collects only the data they deem necessary to provide and improve their services. They categorize the collected data into Personal Information, App Data, and Shared Data, and outline what each category entails.
- Accuracy: Though it does not explicitly mention mechanisms for ensuring data accuracy, they provide a means for users to access their data which lets them make updates or changes, hence inherently allowing for accuracy.
- Storage Limitation: The policy states that they store the data in a secure manner that is accessible only to authorized personnel and is only disclosed under the provisions of the policy. However, it's not explicitly stated how long data will be stored.
- Integrity and Confidentiality: Pinger mentions they have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the data loss, misuse, and alteration under their control.
So, in summary, the policy meets multiple Good Privacy Policy Standards. However, it would benefit from more explicit details regarding the accuracy of the data and storage duration to fully adhere to all GDPR Article 5 principles."
40,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Chikii is comprehensive and seems to adhere to the GDPR principles.
1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: They offer a clear and transparent account of the data they collect (Section I) and how this data is used and shared (Section II).
2. Purpose Limitation: The purposes for data collection and processing are outlined, and the policy mentions that data will be used in a manner consistent with the policy (Section II, 1. A).
3. Data Minimization: They state that they collect as little data as possible while ensuring quality services (Section I, 1. A).
4. Accuracy: They allow users to update their information to ensure its accuracy (Section V, 1 & 2).
5. Storage Limitation: They provide a procedure for users to request their account to be deleted and specify that data will not be retained indefinitely (Section III, 2 & V, 4).
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: They outline their commitment to data security and provide procedures for data breaches (Section IV).
However, since the policy doesn't provide a specific time frame for data retention and it collects some excessive personal details (like passport and ID), it's essential for users to understand these aspects before consenting."
41,Social,10M+,Bad Standard,"The primary concern with this privacy policy is its vagueness and omission of key details, leading to transparency issues. The policy collects a massive amount of personal data (Section 2 and 3), which suggests a lack of data minimization. It also fails to disclose the legal basis for processing data, a fundamental requirement under GDPR principles. Furthermore, the policy mentions sharing user information with third parties (Section 7 and 8), but it's not clear whether explicit user consent is taken for such sharing, neglecting lawfulness, and fairness principles. The policy also does not specify any duration or criteria for data storage (Section 9), compromising"
42,Social,10M+,Bad Standard,"The reasons are as follows, according to specific sections:
1. The ""Data Minimization"" principle: The policy of Iconic Hearts collects an extensive amount of personal information, including inferences based on prior data, network activity information and even the user's contacts. Some of these data collection aspects may be seen as excessive and not strictly necessary for their stated purpose, thus violating the data minimization principle.
2. The ""Purpose Limitation"" principle: The privacy policy does not state if the data collected will not be further processed in a manner incompatible with the original purposes. Therefore, the scope of the data may not be effectively limited.
3. The ""Transparency and Lawfulness"" principle: The privacy policy does little to ensure that the average user fully understands what is happening with their data, thereby violating the transparency principle. Also, it’s unclear about any given user’s consent to process the data, violating the lawfulness principle.
4. The ""Storage Limitation"" principle: The privacy policy does not specify how long the data will be stored, which breaches the storage limitation principle.
5. The ""Rights of the Individual"" principle: The policy mentions the rights of Californian individuals, but it does not provide a detailed and easy method for individuals from other locations to access, correct, or remove their data which infringes on the rights of individuals from other regions.
6. The “Integrity and Confidentiality” principle: The policy mentions taking reasonable steps to protect personal identifying information but it doesn’t specify any concrete measures regarding the protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage."
43,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy lays out a clear lawful basis for data processing, namely user consent and the legitimate interest of verifying user identity and providing a functional, safe user environment. It complies with the principle of fairness as it describes how sensitive data is handled, gives users the option not to disclose certain information and states that private details such as birthdates, phone numbers, gender, email addresses and verification selfies are not publicly visible. The policy emphasizes transparency with a clear explanation of data collection, use, and sharing policies. This privacy policy adheres to the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization, stating that data will be collected and processed for specific, stated purposes such as account setup and profile verification, and only collects data relevant and necessary for these purposes. The privacy policy provides mechanisms to ensure data accuracy, giving users the ability to report accounts, request help, make a claim, participate in a survey or exercise their privacy rights. The policy lays out storage limitation where technical data associated with user content is processed and stored. The policy also assures the integrity and confidentiality of user data with profiles verified using a valid ID and a selfie and they collect GPS coordinates and approximate locations based on the IP address. The policy states that it does not process user payment details, which are instead collected and processed by the app store. Finally, there are clear protocols to address legal proceedings and safety concerns in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and law enforcement bodies."
44,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy is very clear about the types of personal information collected i.e. device information, optionally email, for account recovery purposes, financial and billing information during purchase, diagnostic/reporting in case of technical errors. All these are stated to be voluntary and do not impact the use of the services if not provided. The purpose of data collection is justifiable and limited. This policy also prominently acknowledges the use of commonly used data collection tools like cookies, log files and web beacons and it goes so far as to provide a means to opt-out of tracking via Google Analytics. There's also clear stipulation that they do not use GPS technology to track real time geographic location of users but they use IP addresses for generalities. Each data is categorized and described appropriately and the language is clear, accessible and easy to understand, thus upholding the requirements of transparency, data minimization, purpose limitation and accuracy in GDPR."
45,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy is comprehensive and contains most of the elements required per GDPR standards. The policy clearly states the types of personal data collected, the basis for processing this data (such as consent or legitimate interest), how the data is used, and with whom it is shared. It addresses data minimization by collecting only necessary data for stated purposes (for example, account information for enabling account creation and use, or mobile contacts for enhancing the user experience through connection support). It also provides information on data accuracy by giving users the ability to rectify or update their data (for example, through the rights and choices available to users). The policy also indicates the period for which the data will be retained (only as long as necessary for the purposes for which they are processed). Data integrity and confidentiality are addressed by outlining measures against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal data.
Moreover, the policy sets forth specific means by which users can exercise their rights pertaining to their personal data (under the ""Your Rights and Choices"" section) and provides contact information for privacy queries. It also informs users of potential international data transfers and the safeguards in place to protect personal data in such instances.
However, the policy does not state whether actions will be taken to erase or rectify inaccurate data, but rather places the responsibility on the user to correct their own data. The policy does mention that information collected may be reviewed for trust and safety violations, which may imply some level of screening for accuracy. Furthermore, although the policy does list contact information for questions or concerns, it could be more explicit about the methods available to users wishing to request access to, or removal of, their personal data, including a direct link to a request form or a clear description of the data management process."
46,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The content of the policy demonstrates good standards as it clearly states specific and legitimate purposes for data collection (authentication and analysis in this case). However, it doesn't inform about the exact data minimisation methods, storage limitations, and measures taken to ensure data integrity and confidentiality, so a more thorough examination would be required to comprehensively assess its standard."
47,Social,10M+,Bad Standard,"This policy includes some questionable practices and lacks clarity on a few matters. Specifically:
1. While the policy mentions how they collect personal data, it doesn't specifically outline the legal basis under which they're doing so, which could be consent, contractual necessity etc, which is against the principle of lawfulness.
2. According to the principle of purpose limitation, the policy should specify the exact purposes for data collection, however this policy vaguely states that the data collected may be used to improve their services without providing specifics or asserting that data will not be used in a manner incompatible with these purposes.
3. In regards to data minimization, the policy doesn't ensure that they only collect data necessary for the stated purposes.
4. Concerning transparency, the policy is not clear on who the data may be shared with - it merely states 'authorized third parties', which is not clear to the user.
5. Finally, the policy doesn't specifically mention how they ensure the accuracy of data nor any measures to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. They merely state they take reasonable measures to preserve the integrity and security but there are no details as to what these measures are.
Due to these reasons, the privacy policy of Chatous can be deemed as of a 'Bad' standard."

49,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The policy presents a comprehensive view on how MediaLab.AI collects, uses, shares, and stores user data, upholding the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. It is explicit about the purposes of data collection (e.g. to provide and improve services, deliver content and advertising, monitor and analyze use of the services). It demonstrates data minimization by collecting only necessary data and further specifies categories of data it does not collect. Users are given control over their data, with the option to update, delete, or withdraw consent for data collection. The policy also addresses storage limitation by indicating that deleted whispers may remain in storage for a limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or system backup reasons. Lastly, it shows commitment to data integrity and confidentiality, stating that they share data sparingly and only under specific circumstances. They also provide contacts for inquiries regarding user data rights and privacy concerns."
50,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Parallel Space Lite generally seems to conform to the criteria for good privacy policy standards. It outlines the data it collects, and goes beyond to distinguish between Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information in sections 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, advocating for transparency. It shows commitment to data minimization by not collecting personal data (section 1.1). It appears transparent in its declaration of data use, disclosing the information accessed and collected, how it will be used (section 2), and shared (section 3). It provides assurance of security in section 4 and appears to maintain the principle of fairness and lawfulness by stating that the information is accessed or disclosed only with user permission. There's an acknowledgment of access to sensitive info like microphone, camera, and location but it also states that user permission is required (section 1.3). However, it lacks clarity on the duration of data storage. |"
51,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy documents of Pinger demonstrate a good standard of privacy policy as per the GDPR Article 5 principles. Here are some reasons suggesting why:
1. Lawfulness and Fairness: Pinger states that it collects customer information to enhance the use of its services, improve its products, provide product notifications, and deliver advertisements. This suggests a lawful and legitimate interest for data processing.
2. Transparency: The document clearly specifies the types of information Pinger collects and uses, which include Personal Information, App Data, and Shared Data. Pinger explicitly describes each of these data types, articulating what they consist of and thereby offering clear, candid information to the user.
3. Purpose Limitation: Pinger has clearly stated that it uses customer information to enhance user experience and improve its products and services. These purposes are specified, explicit, and legitimate.
4. Data Minimization and Accuracy: The policy suggests the collection of only necessary data pertinent to the functioning of Pinger's services. The document does not explicitly mention measures in place for ensuring the accuracy of data collected.
5. Storage Limitation: Nothing on the policy specifies the retention of customer data past its requirement, signifying adherence to the storage limitation principle.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: Pinger has mentioned having physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect loss, misuse, and alteration of customer information. The document further emphasizes that the gathered data is accessible only to authorized Pinger personnel.
Considering all these points, the privacy policy can be classified as of a 'Good Standard.' However, it would be more substantial if the company also included a mention of mechanisms ensuring data accuracy and the precise duration of its data retention."
52,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided is well-structured, informative and comprehensive, fulfilling several key principles outlined by GDPR Article 5. To elaborate:
1. Lawfulness: The privacy policy mentions how data is being processed (such as personal data collected, through rewards, registration on Hoop etc.) and states that Dazz is the data controller, with user consent implied.
2. Transparency: Information is transparently provided about how data is collected, used and shared. Crucial information regarding registration, profile creation, parental control, connecting to other users, rewards, administrative management etc. are mentioned.
3. Purpose Limitation: The policy specifically mentions the uses of data – for registration, profile creation, connection with other users etc.
4. Data Minimization: The data collected is aligned with the purposes stated - for example, only necessary data such as Snapchat username, link to the TikTok account, age and country are collected for registration. Even the Personalized ads and non-personalized ads collect information specifically needed for their function.
5. Accuracy: The policy allows for profile information to be changed at any time - indicating an effort at keeping data accurate.
6. Storage Limitation: Although the policy does not specify the exact time period of data storage, it mentions how data is used for specific functions, with an implied assumption that the data will not be kept indefinitely after that use is fulfilled.
7. Integrity and Confidentiality: The policy outlines several scenarios where Dazz ensures the security of data – such as in detection and prevention of abuse on Hoop and administering technical maintenance.
Though the policy does not provide direct information on certain principles such as explicit user consent, and specified storage limitation period, the policy leans more towards a good standard considering the satisfactory fulfillment of other guidelines. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating user consent acquisition and mentioning data retention timelines in line with the GDPR regulations."
53,Social,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy addresses all key points as per the GDPR Article 5 principles.
- Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: The policy provides clear information on the data collection, use, and disclosure practices, including the automatic collection of data and use of cookies. It explains that users consent to these practices by choosing to use the services and submit their personal information (Para 2).
- Purpose limitation: The policy details the specific purposes for which data is collected, such as operating the service, facilitating payments, responding to inquiries, conducting promotional activities, and complying with legal requirements (under ""How We Use and Disclose Personal Information"").
- Data minimization: The policy indicates that they collect personal information voluntarily provided by the users, and specifies what this information might include (under ""Information Collection"").
- Accuracy: The policy allows users to access, update, delete, or correct their personal data (under ""How you can manage your information"").
- Storage limitation: The policy mentions that they may store the user's information even after the user deletes his/her account, but this is limited to a period of 3 months (under ""How you can manage your information"").
- Integrity and confidentiality: The policy declares that they take security measures to protect personal information; however, it also discloses that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure (under ""Security"").
However, as the policy mentions that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure (under ""Security""), it gives a hint that Peeks Social is being transparent about potential lapses in its security measures. This reinforces the integrity of their practices."

They also mention the collection of non-personal identity information and other device-related data, yet they do not assure the user of data minimization, meaning they might be collecting more data than necessary. The statement also does not make it clear about the data retention period or how users can modify or delete their data, conflicting with principles of storage limitation and accuracy.

2. Purpose Limitation: The document outlines the specific purposes for collecting user data, for instance, for improving the application, processing requests and transactions, performing marketing analysis, and developing products and services (Section 2).
3. Data Minimization: The data mentioned that they collect appears narrowly defined and directly related to the services that the application provides.
4. Accuracy: The policy includes procedures for updating and correcting data inaccuracies (Section 8).
5. Storage Limitation: The document mentions that they retain user data only as long as it's needed to provide services or as required by applicable laws (Section 8).
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: The Privacy Policy shows that data is shared strictly on a need-to-know basis (Section 4), and the document includes measures to ensure data confidentiality, such as standard contractual clauses (Section 6).
It should be noted though that while the policy seems to be adhering to the principles, the amount of data they collect (as listed in Section 2), particularly those related to the device and usage, may be seen as excessive. Depending on the nature of the service or the app, this might contradict the principle of data minimization. A more thorough understanding of the app's services is necessary to comprehensively assert this point."
67,Social,10M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy does not adequately address several of the GDPR principles, making it of a Bad Standard. Specifically, the policy is not transparent about how data is collected, used, shared, and stored, using vague and broad language such as ""All information obtained from user use of the app may be used for the advertising and marketing purposes."" and ""various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service."" Also, the policy does not give a clear explanation for the legal basis for data processing or exhibit the principle of data minimization. It appears to collect excessive permissions that go beyond what is necessary for a messaging app to function (like Biometric Data, Motion sensors, non-continuous geolocation). The policy doesn't mention procedures to ensure data accuracy or the storage limitation period. Similarly, it doesn't provide any information about the security measures in place to protect the data. All these denote a lack of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality."
68,Social,50K+,Bad Standard,"While the privacy policy attempts to explain the data it collects and how it is used, it fails to meet Good Standard criteria due to a number of reasons. Firstly, the policy is vague about the legal basis for data processing, it does not specifically state whether it is based on user consent or any other grounds. Secondly, though the policy states that it collects data with user consent, it does not specify how consent is obtained ensuring lawfulness. Additionally, the privacy policy is not clear about data retention period, it doesn’t provide clear information on how long user data is stored, violating the principle of storage minimization. Finally, the policy does not provide any details about the security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access and accidental data loss, breach of the principles of integrity and confidentiality. It also does not offer an easy way for users to update or correct their data, falling short of the accuracy standard."
69,Social,50K+,Good Standard,"The policy brief provides a clear explanation of the principles of data processing that includes the lawfulness, data minimization, purpose limitation, storage limitation, rights of data subject, transparency and security of data. It specifies the data collected, use of cookies, third-party involvement and their roles, and emphasizes security measures. However, it would be better if the policy mentioned how the data subject can keep their personal data accurate and up to date to completely follow the accuracy principle."
70,Social,50K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Ucmate is of good standard. The policy is clear about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. It explicitly states its lawful basis for data processing, which is user consent when choosing to use the service. It clearly outlines reasons why third-party companies may be employed and assures that these third parties are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose, adhering to the principle of purpose limitation. The policy also discusses data security measures, though it does admit that no method can guarantee absolute security. However, there are a few areas where the policy could provide more specifics, such as the retention period for storage limitation, and greater details about the data minimization process. Overall, it seems to follow GDPR principles quite well."
71,Social,50K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy adheres closely to the standards laid out by GDPR Article 5 principles, thereby qualifying as a Good Standard.
In the section, ""What information we hold about you"", they transparently detail the information collected, including the name, email address and the IP address, thereby following the principle of fairness and transparency.
""How your personal information is used"" section clearly outlines the purpose of data collection and processing, and reflects adherence to the principle of purpose limitation and data minimisation by stating that the collected information is used to facilitate user activities pertinent to the forum.
They pay attention to data accuracy as indicated in the section ""Rights"", where users are given the opportunity to access, correct or erase their data, thereby adhering to data accuracy and storage limitation principles.
The policy also holds up the principles of integrity and confidentiality. Mentioned under ""Keeping your data secure"", they emphasize their commitment to data security with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data confidentiality.
Finally, they demonstrate the principle of lawfulness by obtaining explicit acceptance of their privacy policy during user registration, proving their commitment to obtaining informed consent."

They also provide information on users' rights such as accessing, updating, correcting, and deleting personal information, and the use of cookies. The policy outlines the purposes for which data is processed, including purposes such as providing the service, complying with law, and optimizing the platform. They also provide information on data retention and deletion. Their base of operations and data transfer is also clearly outlined, taking into account users from different regions, including the EU and California. They further clarify that the service is not intended for anyone under 13, and they do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under this age, therefore complying with COPPA. Overall, the privacy policy appears comprehensive, straightforward, and in adherence to GDPR principles."

The policy indicates what information they collect, why they collect it, how it’s used, and how long they retain it, hence satisfying the principle of purpose limitation and storage limitation. The commitment to security is also clearly stated, supporting integrity and confidentiality. They mention obtaining user consent for collecting certain data, which complies with the lawfulness principle. The policy also provides clear instructions for users to access, rectify, or remove their information, which upholds the accuracy of the data. Overall, the privacy policy of Plenty of Fish adheres to the GDPR principles, classifying it as a Good Standard."
76,Social,50M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy presents a clear and transparent declaration of how textPlus, Inc. collects, uses, protects, and discloses Personal Information, Usage Data, Message Data, and Contact Data, adhering to the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. The policy explicitly states the legal basis for processing data (user consent) and provides a transparent account of how data is gathered, used, shared, and stored. Information collected is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary, indicating data minimization. Regarding the accuracy of data, the policy allows users to delete, modify or update their Personal Information at any time, ensuring the integrity of personal data. The policy also addresses storage limits by stating that stored message content is deleted from their servers after 36 months and provides information about the security measures implemented to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. However, there might be concerns on how personal information is shared with third parties such as Service Providers and Ad Networks, even if these entities are required to maintain confidentiality. In terms of Children's privacy, the application does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, ensuring another level of data protection. The policy also provides mechanisms for users to manage their information preferences and provides contact details for further queries, enhancing transparency. Overall, the policy abides by the GDPR Article 5 principles and would be considered of Good standard."
77,Social,50M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy demonstrates a great adherence to the GDPR Article 5 principles, covering all key areas. The legal basis is explicit, as mentioned under the ""How we use your personal information"" section and it has a strong commitment towards data minimization, explaining they do not store unnecessary information (such as the Instagram handle of the Message Sender). Transparency is clear throughout the policy, with an easily understandable explanation of their practices. They also show a purpose limitation in explaining the specific purposes of data processing, such as ""Providing and supporting the Services."" The policy assures users about the integrity and confidentiality of their data, detailing their security practices, and explaining how they will share data with third parties (""How we share your personal information""). The company also maintains the accuracy of data as users can provide updates for their data, request a copy, or request deletion, outlined in the ""Your rights and choices"" section. Lastly, this policy nicely encapsulates the storage limitation principle in “Retention of personal information,” indicating data will be kept only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes it was collected for."

It includes sections explaining the types of data collected (sections 2 and 2.1 - 2.8), gives clear explanations of the purposes of data use (section 4), and emphasizes data minimization and accuracy (sections 4.1 and 12). It mentions storage limitation by asserting it does not keep Log Data beyond 30 days (2.3) and commits to only retaining data as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined (section 12). It also mentions integrity and confidentiality of data, outlining robust security measures to protect data (Section 11), and ensures lawful basis for data processing through user consent or to comply with legal obligations (Section 5). Users are informed of their rights concerning their data (Section 13) and the means to exercise these rights (Section 14).

Users are also provided with the option to not use the service if they disagree with the policy (transparency).
2. Purpose Limitation: The privacy policy states specific purposes for data collection, such as connecting users with others, improving services, and legal compliance.
3. Data Minimization: The policy mentions collecting device data, interaction data, etc which seem necessary considering the nature of services (connection and social media related).
4. Accuracy: Users can modify their profiles at any time hence ensuring that the data is up-to-date.
5. Storage Limitation: The document does not specifically mention the exact data retention periods but does suggest that users can request data removal at any time.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: The document discusses the measures taken to ensure data security, like restricted access to personal data and password protection.
Even though it meets several criteria, the document could be improved by adding specific data retention periods and clearer detailing of the rights of the users."
80,Social,100K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy from Pikkado shows compliance with the GDPR Article 5 principles as it demonstrates lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, and storage limitation.
Lawfulness and fairness are visible within its commitment to the protection of personal privacy. The details about the collection of personal data is transparently shared, naming exactly what type of data is collected.
The policy explicitly mentions the purpose of data collection which is in line with the principle of purpose limitation. It collects only necessary data which adheres to the principle of data minimization.
For storage limitation, user has the option to delete the group which eliminates all related information, further noting that over the years it does not keep a history of data that users have deleted, which shows good storage practices.
However, the policy hasn't explicitly stated practices regarding data accuracy and integrity and confidentiality. Adding more detail on how Pikkado ensures the accuracy and security of the data they collect would strengthen the policy."
81,Social,100K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy covers several key aspects of GDPR principles. It clearly outlines its compliance with lawfulness by stating that its the use of its service is subject to users' consent and agreement to the Terms and Conditions (Aceptación). It places a limitation on the purpose and content that users can share on the platform, which speaks to the purpose limitation and integrity of data principles (Regulación de Contenido). User's data such as internet connection information, IP addresses, and device characteristics are collected and these are pertinent to providing the service, addressing data minimization (Datos del Usuario).
Additionally, it reassures users that they don't collect personal information that hasn't been declared in the policy, reinforcing transparency and fairness. It further states that it doesn't share user data with third parties which is again aligned with GDPR principles. Finally, it addresses users from the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, asking for their consent explicitly for advertising purposes and shares data with ad providers, demonstrating its regards for GDPR principles specific to these demographics (Usuarios del Espacio Económico Europeo y del Reino Unido)."
82,Social,100K+,Bad Standard,"This privacy policy lacks clarity and explicitness regarding several key points. While it does mention security measures such as password protection and encrypted connections, it doesn't explicitly convey the legal basis for data processing and doesn't fully demonstrate fairness and transparency.
There is no clear statement on the data minimization principle. The policy mentions collecting essential and optional information but does not specifically detail what this information entails and how it is relevant to the services being provided, demonstrating a lack of data minimization.
It is also unclear about purpose limitation. Although the policy reveals that data is used for service provision, promotional purposes, and dispute resolution, it doesn't precisely outline the specific purposes for data collection and use. This denotes a failure to adhere strictly to the purpose limitation principle.
Moreover, the policy does not explicitly outline the duration for which collected data will be stored. It allows for data removal upon request from the user, but does not provide an established timeframe for data retention, which goes against the principle of storage limitation.
Also, while the policy does mention the use of third-party servers and services, it is non-transparent about the exact nature of these third-party interactions, which could potentially lead to a lack of fairness and transparency.
In addition, while it does mention the sharing of user data under certain circumstances (like legal compulsion), it does not provide clear, concrete examples of when and how such sharing might occur, contributing to a lack of transparency.
Ultimately, while this policy has several elements that adhere to good privacy policies, it also contains numerous omissions and lacks clarity and specificity, thus failing to fully comply with GDPR standards. As such, it must be classified as a ""Bad"" privacy policy based on the provided standards."
83,Social,100K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Pernals seems to exhibit a strong adherence to privacy policy standards derived from the GDPR Article 5 principles.

It upholds the principle of lawfulness by indicating that data processing is based on user consent and for legitimate interests such as improving services and ensuring legal compliance (Section: How We Use Information). There's evidence of transparency as well, making sure the user understands their privacy practices through clear and understandable language and by minimizing legal jargon.
The company respects the principle of data minimization by collecting only necessary data for a specific purpose (Section: Information You Give Us). There's a purpose limitation as well as it indicates their data will not be used beyond the stated purposes (Section: How We Use Information).
Regarding the accuracy principle, the policy provides a mechanism for users to update or rectify their data (Section: Your Rights). Pernals also ensures the principle of storage limitation by permitting users to delete their accounts, though it doesn't specify data retention periods precisely (Section: Your Rights).
It upholds the principles of integrity and confidentiality with a clear commitment to protect user information from unauthorized access, with an acknowledgement of its duty to keep user data secure (Section: How We Protect Your Information).
Despite the omission of specific data retention periods, the comprehensiveness and clarity of the policy, along with the commitment to adhere to key principles, warrant a ""Good"" classification. Please note that this assessment is limited to the content provided and may not reflect the company's actual practices."
84,Social,100K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy adequately covers essential GDPR principles. It informs about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information aligning with the transparency principle. It clarifies third-party service providers’ role and their access to personal data, adhering to the lawfulness and fairness principles. Also, the policy highlights security concerns, striving to use commercially acceptable means of protection, although absolute security cannot be guaranteed. It underlines lawfulness by obtaining users' agreement for data processing before using the service and meets the child protection requirements by not knowingly collecting data from children under 13. However, the policy could improve on the data minimization, purpose limitation, and storage limitation descriptions for a more comprehensive approach."
85,Social,100K+,Bad Standard,"The policy is not transparent in terms of third-party data sharing and does not clearly state the users' rights to access, rectify, delete, or object to the use of their personal data, as required under the GDPR principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and accuracy. Additionally, the policy allows for the excessive collection of data (user’s birthday, gender, hometown, bio, education, career, profile image, email address, phone number etc). Also the policy states that it retains data 'for a reasonable period as may be necessary' but does not specify a definite period for data storage nor the criteria to determine the acceptable duration, which goes against the GDPR principle of storage limitation. Furthermore, the policy gives another red flag when saying that it may monitor user's private messages, an action that seems unfair with regards to user's rights and freedoms."
86,Social,100K+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy lacks key elements to deem it as a Good Standard. There is no clear legal basis for data processing through Firebase Analytics and there is no explicit mention of user consent needed, which compromises on the principles of lawfulness and fairness introduced by GDPR.

There is no mention of data minimization and it is unclear what specific data is being collected. The privacy policy does not detail how or if they are taking measures to ensure data accuracy. Furthermore, there's no mention of a retention period for user data that's being collected, implying a breach in the principle of storage limitation. Lastly, there is no mention of any security measures to safeguard the collected data, neither is there any mention on upholding integrity and confidentiality of user data, indicating a lack of adherence to established principles of data protection."
87,Social,100K+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy meets good standards by satisfying many of the GDPR Article 5 principles. It provides a clear legal basis for data processing (user consent upon registration and use of the application), and demonstrates transparency by explicitly stating what user-provided information is collected (email, transaction-related info, and any information given when the user seeks help). The policy also cites that user data will be used for important notifications and marketing promotions, thus meeting the purpose limitation principle. Further, the policy articulates its data minimization strategy by only asking for information integral to the usage of the application. The accuracy principle is adhered to via user-provided information, and the policy outlines the duration and conditions under which the data will be stored. This policy also incorporates principles of integrity and confidentiality, setting forth the measures taken to safeguard user information such as limiting access to authorized personnel and having mechanisms of encryption. Lastly, it provides multiple opt-out options for users, including uninstalling the application and disabling access to location data. However, some clarity is needed regarding third party sharing, especially advertising entities in maintaining strict compliance with absolute transparency.

1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: The policy clearly states the purposes for data collection, use and sharing as to provide and improve the Service (e.g. the app collects data in case of an error through Log Data). It also informs users that third-party service providers may collect identifiable information.
2. Purpose Limitation: The policy clearly states that the Personal Information collected is used for providing and improving the Service, hence it aligns with the principle of purpose limitation.
3. Data Minimization: The data collected by the policy seems to be confined to what's necessary for improving the service (e.g., in the case of an error, Log Data is collected).
4. Accuracy: Although it doesn't explicitly talk about allowing users to rectify inaccuracies, it does provide a contact email where users can raise questions or suggestions, thus, creating a potential avenue for data rectification.
5. Storage Limitation: The policy does not explicitly state the retention period of the data, which is a shortfall but it does state that it can update its privacy policy from time to time.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: The policy indicates a commitment towards data security, albeit stating that absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
However, the policy could be improved by explicitly stating the retention period of user data and providing mechanisms that allow users to rectify or erase their data."

In terms of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, Keybase clearly outlines its various data processing activities, legal bases for processing and the kinds of personal data it collects from users such as names, email addresses, user activity and hashed passwords. It also explains how the data will be used - to provide services, protect and improve Keybase, and communicate about Keybase to users. Through the clear presentation of information without complex legal jargon, Keybase maintains good transparency.
In terms of data minimization, Keybase only collects relevant data that is essential to their service offering. Particularly, it is explicitly mentioned that Keybase does not unnecessarily require a phone number or email address to maintain an account.
The policy also highlights that data is stored temporarily, expressing a commitment to the GDPR principle of storage limitation. Furthermore, the policy demonstrates respect for the principle of accuracy by allowing users to update their data through their Keybase client.
Finally, concerning principles of integrity and confidentiality, Keybase outlines the security measures they have in place, such as password protection, client-side encryption and utilization of a whitelist for services preconditioning/system alterations, to ensure that personal data is protected against unauthorized access.
While the policy does indicate that some types of data (account activity, for instance) cannot be fully deleted, justifying this as a security measure, this may be an area to look into for potential improvement. However, overall Keybase's privacy policy can be considered a good standard."

It fails to mention any measures put in place to ensure data accuracy or the time period for which data will be stored."
95,Social,500+,Bad Standard,"This document does have elements that respect the principles of GDPR, however there are specific elements that make it of a Bad Standard.
Concerning the principle of lawfulness, the document states that it collects information to provide better services but it's unclear how the user provides consent for this data collection and no other legal basis is specified.
Regarding fairness and transparency, the document is not explicit about who besides third-party advertisers might gain access to users' data. Furthermore, while it refers to cookies, it is unclear how these are used and what data they collect precisely.
The document fails to specify the exact purposes for data collection in a concrete manner which means it doesn't adhere completely to purpose limitation principle.
Discussing data minimization, the document mentions extensive data collection, from demographic details to online activity and cookies, without clearly specifying why all this information is necessary.
The policy does not explain how it ensures data accuracy and while it describes some security measures, it is not completely conclusive about the mechanisms in place to protect data and respond to potential breaches, failing on the principles of accuracy and integrity and confidentiality.
Additionally, there is no clear mention to storage limitation principles, especially there's absence of the time period for which personal data will be stored.
All these reasons show non-compliance or poor practices in relation to GDPR Article 5 principles which conclude the Bad Standard of the document."
96,Social,500+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy by Pocket Match app demonstrates several misalignments with the good privacy policy standards.
- On the aspect of transparency, the policy does not provide clear and easy-to-understand information about the use and disclosure of personal information. It vaguely states that the personal information collected is for providing and improving the service without specifying what these services are, thus contravening the principle of purpose limitation.
- The policy also mentions the use of third-party services without extensively detailing who these third parties are and how they use the collected information. The link provided directs to Google Play Services, but it does not clarify whether Google Play Services is the only third-party service or one of many, raising concerns about the fairness and transparency principles.
- Regarding storage limitation, the policy does not provide any indication of how long user data is retained, which violates the principle of storage limitation.
- In terms of data minimization, the packet match app is collecting personally identifiable information such as first name, last name, gender, facebook profile image link, facebook id, latitude, and longitude, which seems excessive for a game application.
- With regards to security, the policy states they are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting user data, but it also admits that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable. Albeit true, the statement is very general and does not detail any specific measures the app takes to secure user data, failing to comply with the principles of integrity and confidentiality."

This document is detailed on how personal information is collected, used, stored, and disclosed, specifically mentioning the types of data collected (e.g., Log Data, Google Play Billing information) and the reasons for collecting this data. Transparency is maintained as third-party APIs used are openly listed, redirecting users to their privacy policies. Data minimization is evident as data collection is restricted to what's necessary to improve the app, without collecting any personally identifiable information. It outlines the types of permissions required by the app, their purpose, and how data is stored on the device, conforming to purpose limitation, and data minimization principles. The policy also commits to data security, though it acknowledges that no method is 100% secure. Users are informed about potential changes to the policy, a proactive step towards ensuring continued awareness and consent. Finally, there's respect for children's privacy, indicating no services are provided to those under 13, complying with child data protection regulations."
99,Social,500K+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy of 'imo' seems to contradict multiple principles laid out by the GDPR.
1. Lawfulness: While 'imo' collects a massive amount of personal information and certainly mentions user consent, it does not specify the legal basis of its other data processing activities thereby shrouding its approach in ambiguity. It also reserves the right to share personal information with third parties without prior notice or obtaining additional consent.
2. Transparency: The policy is packed with dense paragraphs that most users may find hard to understand. The language,though complete, can be considered complex.
3. Data Minimization: The app seems to collect more data than is necessary, such as chat history, log information, contact information from a user's mobile address book, and more.
4. Accuracy: There is no explicit assurance that 'imo' will make efforts to ensure and maintain the accuracy of data.
5. Storage Limitation: Although 'imo' mentions a 90-day retention period for chat histories, it doesn't clarify retention periods for other data it collects. If a user is a premium subscriber, the retention period can extend beyond 90 days for chat histories.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: While 'imo' states it provides protection for user data, it admits that it cannot fully guarantee the integrity and security of said data. This falls short of ensuring appropriate security as outlined in GDPR principles.
Therefore, considering the above details it can be concluded that the policy lacks specificity and concrete provisions to guard user data privacy, falling short in a GDPR-compliant context."
