1,Business,1B+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy is clearly written and easily understandable. Transparency and lawfulness are demonstrated by the explicit mentions of using user data to provide services (like making connections, suggested job opportunities, educational roles, etc). In terms of purpose limitation, all data usage is specifically outlined and tied directly back to the service the company provides. Moreover, the user has a certain degree of control over their data, and can choose who can see their information or connect with them, aligning with the principles of fairness and lawfulness. Data minimization is practiced to an extent, with only necessary data for the provision of their services being used. However, regarding data accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality, the policy does not provide clear information on how long user data is stored, how user data is ensured to be accurate and the specific measures taken to secure user data. But based on the available information, the policy appears to meet most of the principles of good standard."

The policy also addresses the aspect of storage limitation, despite not mentioning a specific retention duration, it indicates that data will not be stored longer than it is necessary, especially when deleting an account. Lastly, the policy asserts that they have appropriate security measures in place to protect the users' data integrity and confidentiality under its ''Security'' section. Overall, OfferUp has shown a considerable level of commitment to the GDPR guidelines."
3,Business,1K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy adheres to the Good Standard due to several reasons:
1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: The policy clearly states the legal basis for processing data (UK GDPR) and ensures that the data processing does not unjustly affect the data subject. It mentions the specific data being collected and the purposes for which it is collected.
2. Purpose Limitation: The policy demonstrates purpose limitation by specifying that the data collected is used for delivering Health and Safety services, operations, auditing, and analysis which aligns with the information collected.
3. Data Minimization: Although the policy doesn't explicitly state that it is only collecting necessary data, it doesn't mention any excessive collection of data either. The types of data collected listed all relate directly to the services the company provides.

Therefore, on these grounds, the privacy policy aligns with the Good Privacy Policy Standards."
4,Business,1K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Nexxio generally meets the standards set out by the GDPR Article 5. For instance, the policy clearly sets out its legal basis under which customers' data will be collected, used, stored, and shared. It specifies the types of personal data collected, explains how data is collected from various sources, and asserts that data will be used for specific reasons related to the operation and promotion of the Nexxio platform. The policy also provides mechanisms for users to access, review, update, modify, or delete their data, demonstrating a commitment to allowed user's control over their data. As for storage limitation, it mentions that they will retain personal data for as long as reasonably necessary and in event of complaints or potential litigation. Also, integrity and confidentiality are addressed by stating that appropriate security measures are in place and only people with a business need to know will process personal data. Finally, it acknowledges it's responsibility in case of sharing data with third party service providers, stating that these providers are not allowed to use the data for their own purposes but only for specified purposes and in accordance with Nexxio’s instructions. However, the company should provide more specific information about how long the information is kept and specify the measures taken to ensure data security."
5,Business,1K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Yardi Systems demonstrates adherence to the GDPR Article 5 principles hence classifying it as of Good Standard. The policy clearly articulates the lawfulness and transparency of their data processing activities. They emphasize on data minimization by only collecting data relevant for their services. They have a clear commitment to the accuracy and integrity of data; they allow users to correct, update, change or erase personal information. The document assures users of stringent security measures implemented to protect their personal data, stating that Yardi uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures. The document also includes provisions for storage limitation, mentioning that they retain personal information for a period necessary based on their legitimate business needs. This policy exhibits a firm commitment to adhere to the GDPR principles. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the document could be better by specifying the exact period of data retention. Despite this, the overall policy meets the criteria for a Good Standard Privacy Policy."
6,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy conforms to the standards of good privacy policy in several ways. Under the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, the document clearly communicates its data processing activities and the legal basis for such processing, which includes consent from users (California residents in this case). The policy is minimally invasive, which aligns with the principle of data minimization, as it does not attempt to collect or process more data than necessary to fulfill user requests. The policy strongly emphasizes the rights of data subjects including access to personal information, deletion of personal information, correction of inaccuracies, and control over sensitive personal information (SPI), thus upholding the principle of accuracy. As for the principle of storage limitation, it details that personal data would only be stored and processed to the extent required by law. Lastly, the policy demonstrates fairness and integrity by allowing for user control over their personal information, and the organization also provides a procedure for user verification to ensure data security, which aligns with the principles of data integrity and confidentiality."
7,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of TrueBlue, Inc. demonstrates good standards for several reasons.
1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: The document clearly states the purposes of data collection, the type of data collected, and how it is processed (sections regarding ""WHAT INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT AND PROCESS"" and ""HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT""). It also provides information on how data subjects can exercise their rights (""YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES"" section) and is transparent about third-party sharing (""WHO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH"").
2. Purpose Limitation: The privacy policy identifies specific reasons for data collection, which mainly relate to TrueBlue's recruitment, sales, marketing, advertisement, staffing, or employment activities (""This Notice applies to personal information..."" section). It declares that the data will not be used for purposes incompatible with these which provides clarity of purpose limitation.
3. Data Minimization: The policy collects necessary information only pertinent to the employment/professional environment, and this ensures adherence to data minimization.
4. Accuracy: TrueBlue specifies that it attains updates from third-party websites like job search websites or social media in the ""Information Supplied by Others"" section, implying a commitment to maintaining the accuracy of data.
5. Storage Limitation: The policy illustrates storage limitation by committing to retain data for as long as necessary according to the function of its services, legal obligations, and other factors detailed in the ""RETENTION AND DELETION"" section.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: It exhibits a commitment to data security through its measures regarding 'cookies.' Additionally, the firm uses service providers for infrastructure management indicating safeguarding of data.
The privacy policy could have further improved if it provided more specific information about the implemented security measures to protect data and the exact retention periods for different types of data."
8,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy adheres effectively to the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. Lawfulness can be seen where RingCentral mentions its commitment to protect user privacy and it delivers a clear explanation of their privacy practices, showing transparency. Association with the fairness principle is evident where the policy states the presence of choices for users regarding the use, access, deletion, and correction of their personal data. The policy also mentions providing supplemental terms, conditions, privacy statements, and notices at or before data collection, supporting transparency and fairness. However, an all-encompassing classification will require a more detailed review of their practices related to purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity & confidentiality, which is not included in the given information."
9,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy outline provided regarding data collection and usage adheres to the principles of fairness, transparency, and lawfulness. This policy provides clarity on how personal data is collected and it ensures that data processing does not unjustly affect the data subject (""We will ask for your permission when we need the information that can verify your identify or reach you.""). The policy outlines under what circumstances this information would be disclosed, making it transparent in its data handling processes (""We will disclose your personal information in accordance with legal requirements, the relevant terms of service of our company or the software license agreement, or we have good reasons to believe that we have to do so to..."").
Additionally, the policy addresses the principles of data minimization and storage limitation by stating that only relevant data is collected and affirms it will not be shared with third parties without the user's consent (""We don’t require you have to provide any of the above information..."".
Furthermore, the policy abides by the principles of integrity and confidentiality as it strives to protect user data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure (""We strictly protect the security of your personal information. We will use a variety of security techniques and procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.""), demonstrating its alignment with the principles defined by GDPR Article 5.
However, it vaguely addresses the principle of data accuracy as it doesn’t clearly provide information on how users can rectify or update their data."
10,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Tenstreet LLC is in compliance with the standards provided in GDPR principles. Specifically, it shows commitment towards lawfulness by clearly depicting its legal basis for data processing i.e., user consent and usage of services. It also shows fairness by explicitly describing that no personal data of users will be provided to employers unless explicitly directed by users. For transparency, it gives understandable explanations of the users’ data being collected, used, shared, and protected. It clearly intends to collect data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes i.e., for its platform's services. It emphasizes the accuracy of data by taking permission from users to verify their data. Tenstreet also caters to data minimization by only gathering necessary information. As per GDPR principles, it has specified that personal data will be stored for a duration in accordance with the policies of the Employer and as required by law i.e., it follows storage limitations. Additionally, Tenstreet has enforced integrity and confidentiality through strong security measures, safeguarding the users' data against unauthorized access or disclosure."
11,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy appears to adhere well to the GDPR Article 5 principles, indicating that it is of Good Standard. Specifically, it achieves lawfulness by stating that data processing is in compliance with 'Applicable Law' and that consent is obtained where necessary (Section 3.3). The principle of transparency has also been met, as the document thoroughly explains the type of personal information collected by the company from both visitors and users (Section 3), how this data will be used (paragraph 4, referred in Section 3.3) and the automated means used for data collection (Section 3.4). The policy also implies a respect for data minimization in Section 3.2, stating that it doesn't collect unnecessary or excessive personal information; it aligns with accuracy in Section 3.3, promising to disregard irrelevant personal information; and it complies with integrity and confidentiality by assuring that location information will be stored according to storage policies and the Applicable Law (Section 3.4i). However, while it generally meets good privacy standards, there is no explicit mention of storage limitation and specific security measures, which should ideally be included for a comprehensive Good privacy policy."
12,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Motive Technologies, Inc. shows a good standard as it respects many principles of GDPR Article 5 principles. Here's how:
1. Lawfulness: The policy identifies the lawful bases for data processing, mentioning several instances such as 'performance of contract', 'legitimate interest' and 'compliance with law' (section 4).
2. Transparency: The document explains in detail how the company collects, uses, shares, and stores personal data (sections 3, 4, 5, and 6), ensuring individuals are not misled about the usage of their personal data.
3. Purpose Limitation: It specifies the purposes for data collection and use (section 4), insisting that data will not be used in a manner incompatible with these purposes.
4. Data Minimization: The policy doesn't explicitly state that data collection is minimized to what's necessary, but there are no indications of excessive data collection.
5. Accuracy: The policy states that users can access and edit their information at any time (sections 9.1 and  9.2), suggesting measures are in place to support data accuracy.
6. Storage Limitation: It implies a storage limitation policy, stating that data is retained only as long as is reasonably necessary for the stated purposes (section 4).
7. Integrity and Confidentiality: It indicates that reasonable measures are taken to protect personal data from unauthorized access or misuse (section 6.1)
However, there are points for improvement:
- A more explicit commitment to data minimization would strengthen the policy.
- An explicit timeframe for data retention, rather than the phrase “reasonably necessary,” would further improve transparency and meet storage limitation principle.
- There's a large amount of third-party sharing (section 5 and 5.8) which may raise potential concerns. While Motive doesn't appear to obscure this activity and offers some opt-out methods, it's worth noting that too much third-party sharing can sometimes be a red flag.
- The policy states ""Motive does not sell your Personal Information in the traditional sense of the word,"" but it does admit sharing information as part of affiliate advertising networks that might fall under the definition of 'selling' data in the context of laws like CCPA (section 5.10). This is not necessarily bad but could be seen as controversial based on interpretations of data privacy laws.
Overall, the policy does a good job at articulating its data privacy practices and respects the majority of the GDPR principles. Be aware that the decision is dependent on the particular interpretation of the policy and could vary between different privacy experts."
13,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy is stated in clear terms, and is user-friendly. This is demonstrated in sections like “Transparency and choice”, which explains what information is gathered and why, and how the user can control their privacy settings.
The policy outlines a clear legal basis for processing data, directly aligning with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). This complies with the lawfulness principle in GDPR Article 5.
The policy shows a specification on purpose limitation principle by expressing the exact purposes for data collection, such as to improve and offer more personalized services to its users. It includes specific information about data minimization, reason and method of data collection, storage limitation.
The policy also states how personal data is protected from unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction, or damage through the use of robust security measures, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
Moreover, the ""Retention of Personal Data"" section complies with the storage limitation principle by stating that personal information is only stored for as long as necessary to provide the services. The privacy policy also guarantees mechanisms for data accuracy and allows users to easily rectify or update their information, this includes the “Correction” section.
Appendices explain processes to protect consumer rights under GDPR and CCPA, and how to lodge complaints or concerns, this provides further clarity and transparency.
However, the policy could be improved by providing users with a clear indication of the duration for which their data will be stored. Overall, this privacy policy demonstrates good standards because it is compliant with the principles of GDPR Article 5."
14,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The TurboScan Privacy Policy provides clear evidence of upholding principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimization, purpose limitation, storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality. Specifically, the policy discloses the permissions required and the reasons for them (lawfulness). It also mentions clearly that documents are stored locally and shared only when users decide to transfer them to other services (transparency, data minimization, purpose limitation). The policy informs the users about the anonymized and aggregated data collection for analytics to improve the app, but doesn't disclose how to correct inaccurate data (accuracy, purpose limitation). Storage limitation is observed as data is kept on the device and shared only by user action, however, it does not explicitly state a retention period. While there is an emphasis on local storage of data, more detailed information about preventive security measures against data breaches is needed for the integrity and confidentiality part. The ""Changes"" and ""Contact Us"" sections provides transparency but could be more explicit in regard to notifying users about changes in the privacy policy."
15,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of DesignEvo presented by PearlMountain Limited adheres to Good Standard policy. It is clearly outlined and provides comprehensive details on the collection, use, sharing, and storage of user data. The policy addresses the principle of lawfulness, as it states its legitimate reasons for gathering various sets of user data, such as registration, payment, and usage information. The fairness principle is observed as users are given the ability to modify their privacy settings, manage subscriptions, and delete their accounts if they're not satisfied. Transparency is shown as their practices are detailed extensively. Furthermore, the policy demonstrates data minimization by declaring that they will collect no more data than is necessary for providing their services. There is assurance for data accuracy and the possibility for data rectification as users may access and modify their information. On data storage limitation, the policy indicates that they do not store sensitive payment details and only collect necessary data. Lastly, the principle of integrity and confidentiality is demonstrated through the company's commitment to use internationally accepted standards to protect user information from being compromised."
16,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy is quite comprehensive and stipulates clear guidelines in compliance with the principles of GDPR. It explains what data is being collected, the categories in which data is segmentated, and how the data will be used. It covers almost every aspect required by a good privacy policy standard. Among those, the purpose limitation aspect of GDPR has been met as it explicitly outlines the purposes for which the data is collected. The policy also covers the principle of data minimization by stating that data collected is limited to what is necessary to provide the services. The principle of transparency is satisfied because the privacy policy is provided in a clear, open, and understandable manner. The policy also covers the principle of storage limitation by stating that the data accessed is securely stored and can be deleted upon request, and it also describes integrity and confidentiality of data protection. However, there could be more detailed information on the data retention period which could provide more clarity to the users."
17,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy by Grubhub is of a good standard as it abides by the stipulated GDPR Article 5 principles.
1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: The policy clearly states the processing basis for the data it collects, and the specific uses of this data (Sections 1.1 to 1.09). It is transparent about how the data is used, shared, and stored (Sections 1.1 to 1.10, 4.1, 4.2).
2. **Purpose Limitation**: The policy strictly collects and processes data for specific and legitimate purposes which are clearly defined throughout the document (Sections 1.1 to 1.8).
3. **Data Minimization**: Grubhub only collects necessary and relevant data that facilitates their services effectively (Sections 1.1 to 1.8).
4. **Accuracy**: Grubhub makes efforts to keep users’ data accurate through regular updates and encourages users to maintain their information accurately (Section 2.3).
5. **Storage Limitation**: The policy mentions the storage limits for each type of data collected, ending either with the termination of users' accounts with Grubhub or a duration that is necessary for Grubhub's legal obligations and defending against legal claims (Sections 1.1 to 1.8).
6. **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Grubhub has put in place measures to ensure the security of users' data (Section 4.2). It takes immediate steps"
18,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of the Rapid Scanner app built by CJSVM is generally good because it meets most of the standards set by GDPR Article 5 principles.
First and foremost, it clearly states the lawful basis for collecting and processing data, which is for providing and improving its service. Consent is also sought from the users as their agreement to the policy is mandatory if they choose to use the service (Principle of Lawfulness).
The policy is fairly transparent about its practices of using personal information. It informs the users about the information saved on their devices, use of third party services and log data collection in case of app errors (Principles of Transparency and Fairness).
It details the use of third-party service providers, their access to personal info and their obligations to keep it confidential. It also covers aspects of data storage limitation by not keeping any data from users under the age of 13, and promptly deleting any such data discovered (Principles of Purpose Limitation, Data Minimization, and Storage Limitation).
However, while the policy does state the commitment to employ commercially acceptable means to protect personal information, it could do better in confidentiality and integrity standards by detailing the specific security measures taken.
As with any privacy policy, continuous reviews and updates are essential and this document indicates that updates will be implemented from time to time (Principle of Accuracy)."
19,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy outlined is comprehensive and adheres well to the GDPR principles. It clearly states the legal basis for processing data for each purpose, from maintaining website security to event registration, visitor health, and managing user accounts. It assures data is used for explicit, legitimate purposes, integrates data minimization by collecting only necessary data, and allows users to control their data. The policy also mentions accuracy measures, storage limitation factors, and acknowledges the importance of data integrity and security. The company explicitly mentions the use of user consent and takes other reasonable steps such as erasing data that is no longer required. Overall, the policy demonstrates principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and data integrity and confidentiality implicitly and explicitly. The purpose, legal basis, and the process to control the processing are clearly defined making it understandable to average users. Hence, considering the GDPR principles, the policy can be classified as Good Standard."
20,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The overall standards of this privacy policy are good based on the articulation of the corresponding principles in GDPR. This includes aspects such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality.
1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: The policy is clear in its language and covers the data collection and disclosure practices that users can expect. This can be seen in sections such as 'Información Que Recopilamos', 'Cómo Utilizamos Su Información', and 'Cómo Divulgamos la Información'.
2. Purpose Limitation: The policy clearly communicates what purposes personal data will be used for in the section 'Cómo Utilizamos Su Información' and does not indicate that it will be used for unrelated or illegitimate purposes.
3. Data Minimization: From what is provided about the data that is collected, it appears that only necessary data is collected from the user for stated purposes.
4. Accuracy: In the section 'Actualización de Su Cuenta', it is stated that users can edit their personal profile on the service, which provides a mechanism for ensuring the accuracy of data.
5. Storage Limitation: The policy states the retention period for data, seen in the section 'No Participar' stating that they retain the collected information for up to 60 days after termination.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: The section 'Seguridad de Datos' describes certain data security measures in place, which indicates the presence of steps to protect the data from unauthorized access and loss.
However, it would be beneficial for the policy to explicitly provide some additional specifics, such as clarity in terms of data minimization, a legal basis for processing, and details about third-party data sharing practices to fully meet good privacy policy standards."
21,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The policy follows Good Standard as it is comprehensive and follows the GDPR principles.
The policy sets a clear legal basis for data processing, asking for user's explicit and informed consent, thus adhering to the principle of lawfulness - ""By installing, using, registering for, or otherwise accessing our services, you agree to this privacy policy and give an explicit and informed consent to the processing, use, and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.""
The policy aligns with the principle of purpose limitation, detailing the specific reasons they collect personal and non-personal data. For instance, they mention that they collect your email for account authentication and location data for mapping purposes.
The policy outlines data minimization by clearly describing the types of data collected (non-personal and personal), and states that collection is on a voluntary basis. Real Estate Portal USA also specifies situations in which data is collected and for what specific purposes.
The policy also respects the principle of storage limitation, mentioning that they retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes mentioned in the policy.
Real Estate Portal USA takes steps to ensure data integrity and confidentiality as specified by the principles. These include the use of standard industry practices and safeguards to protect the data, restricting access to personal data, and ensuring the security of the stored data.
Finally, the policy asserts users’ rights to access, rectify and delete their personal data, thereby maintaining transparency."
22,Business,1M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy of EasyViewer has several issues that categorize it as bad based on GDPR Article 5 principles. The sections that discuss ""collect, use and provide your non-privacy information to any third party"" are without ensuring explicit user consent which violates the principle of transparency. It lacks clear articulation of methods employed for data minimization and it fails to mention any safeguards for data accuracy. No information about the retention period of the data (storage limitation) is provided. While it does mention that personal information will be used to the extent permitted by law or within the scope of specific authorization, it fails to break down what this includes, avoiding clear communication. Conclusively, the privacy policy lacks a clear description of the implemented security measures to protect user data, breaching the principles of integrity and confidentiality."
23,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy can be considered as having good standards based on several observations. The first point to highlight is the principle of lawfulness. The policy clearly states the legal basis for data processing, including user consent, fulfilling contractual obligations, or compliance with legal requirements. Transparency is also evident in this policy as it clearly outlines what information is collected, how it is used, and the reason behind its collection. It also reveals who is collecting the information and details about third-party sharing.
The policy also adheres to the principle of purpose limitation by specifying the exact reasons for data collection. This aligns with the principle of data minimization as it only collects the necessary data to provide services and fulfill obligations. Again, the principle of accuracy can also be observed in this policy by allowing the data subject to access and update their personal information.
This privacy policy commits to the storage limitation as it details the exact length of time personal data will be retained and the variables influencing this duration. Finally, pertaining to the last principles of integrity and confidentiality, this policy outlines various security measures implemented to protect data from unauthorized access or accidental losses and explains the rights of data subjects and provides contact information for any queries or complaints, satisfying the principle of accountability."
24,Business,1M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Booking.com group demonstrates explicit adherence to the GDPR Article 5 principles as defined by Good Privacy Policy Standards. Here are the specific sections that support this conclusion:

27,Business,5K+,Bad Standard,"The provided policy is incomplete and does not provide enough information to determine whether it adheres to GDPR Article 5 principles. A comprehensive evaluation cannot be done without relevant details pertaining to data processing, data storage, data accuracy, use of personal data and more."
28,Business,5K+,Good Standard,"The policy clearly provides information on the collection, use, and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It emphasizes voluntary submission of PII and assures users that their PII is not sold, shared, or rented to any third party for marketing purposes. The policy clearly states what may be collected (name, address, email, etc.) and the purposes for which this data is used including processing transactions and providing customer service. They also assure that disclosure of PII to third parties is limited and is done only in specific business contexts (like for shipping, payment processing, and legal purposes). Furthermore, they indicate a commitment to updating the privacy policy whenever necessary and demand users' constant review, upholding the principle of transparency. The policy also exhibits an undertaking to the principle of data minimization and storage limitation by clarifying the types of personal data collected and disclosing that it limits PII accessibility to third parties only when necessary. This suggests a culture of restraint in data collection and sharing."
29,Business,5K+,Good Standard,"The policy is generally well constructed and covers a significant portion of the GDPR Article 5 principles. Specific sections where it shows compliance include:
1. The policy specifies what information it collects and how it is used, thereby adhering to the principle of transparency. This includes personal and company details, cookies, communication data, automatic data collection, and location data.
2. The policy mentions that users can contact the company in case they want their provided data to be deleted, indicating a way to maintain data accuracy.
3. The policy underlines the fact that data is retained for as long as the user uses the application and for a reasonable time thereafter, fulfilling the principle of storage limitation.
4. Security of the data is addressed by stating that data will only be shared under limited circumstances, including legal necessities and after getting the users consent, following the principles of lawfulness, and confidentiality.
5. The policy also aligns with purpose limitation by clearly stating that location data, for instance, is collected for providing accurate services to the user.
Even though the policy does not expressly detail security measures to protect the data against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction, or damage, it addresses a significant portion of Good Privacy Policy Standards. Additionally, the use of simple, understandable language makes it more accessible to users."
30,Business,5K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Ecolab does a proper job of adhering to the principles of GDPR Article 5. The policy provides a broad disclosure of how user data is collected, processed, and stored, which is reflective of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. Additionally, it goes in-depth to specify the purpose of data collected, as well as the categories of data collected, which adhere to the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization. The policy also mentions that personal information is retained only for the necessary duration (storage limitation) and that it is processed safely (integrity and confidentiality). It also includes mechanisms for EU users to request the correction or deletion of their data, reflecting the principle of data accuracy. The policy makes a point to state that Ecolab does not knowingly collect data from individuals under the age of 18, showcasing responsibility in handling sensitive data. Despite slight deficiencies like the broad nature of 'service' descriptions and the non-specific length of data retention, the Ecolab privacy policy generally aligns with the Good Standard criteria as set out by GDPR Article 5 principles."
31,Business,5M+,Bad Standard,"The reason is the privacy policy lacks sufficient measures for many of the principles outlined by the GDPR.
- While the policy infers consent by stating ""...if you choose to use my service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy"", there is no explicit process outlined for acquiring granular consent from users prior to collecting and processing their data.
- The policy mentions retaining the information on the user's device but it does not provide specific details on data storage limitation practices such as the time period for which the data will be stored or the criteria used to determine this duration.
- The policy states that the app uses third-party services that ""may collect information used to identify you"" but doesn't explicitly outline which types of personal data may be collected, processed, or shared.
- The principle of data minimization is not well-adhered to, as it takes location data for ads placement. This could be potentially excessive, depending on the nature of the app's service.
- It does not provide any information about how users can rectify inaccurate personal data.
- Lastly, the policy states that ""I cannot guarantee its absolute security"", a statement that can be seen as a failure to ensure data integrity and confidentiality, even if it is a realistic assessment of digital security."
32,Business,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Pinger showcases a significant emphasis on transparency and it suggests strong practices in line with the GDPR Article 5 standards. It specifies the exact types of information collected (Personal Information, App Data, and Share Data) and the purposes for which this data is used (improving services, product notifications, etc.). It explicitly outlines when and how it may share user information with third parties, ensuring consent and legal obligations are met. It also details plans for data integrity and security, noting the use of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect user information. Furthermore, users are given the option to access and remove their personal information, supporting the principle of storage limitation. The explicit mentions of children's privacy and non-intention to allow usage by those under 13 also aligns with the fairness principle. The policy includes a clause about revising its privacy practices periodically, demonstrating the adaptability required for accurate data handling. While the policy does make use of legal and technical language, the overall content is fairly understandable even for a layperson."
33,Business,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of BlueJeans demonstrates transparency by clearly explaining how the company collects, uses, shares, and stores users' data. It lays out the lawful reasons for data processing which include consent, contract fulfilment, legitimate interest, and compliance with the law. This meets the principle of lawfulness.
It fulfils the principle of fairness by stating that the data processing does not detrimentally affect the users.
In terms of transparency, the policy defines key terms and provides elaborate explanations for data processing activities, making it understandable to"
34,Business,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy document provided by Asana abides by the guidelines provided by the GDPR. They explicitly mentioned the purposes for data collection and processing, under their User Content and Submissions on the Service section, and they also ensure users retain ownership of their data. Asana puts necessary measures in place for data protection as indicated in the Unauthorized Account Use section, where it lays down guidelines for notifying Asana in case of any unauthorized use or access to an account. The policy also presents data minimization where only necessary data is being collected as stated in the Account Registration and Confidentiality section. However, the policy lacks clarity on how long will the data be stored (Storage limitation) and does not provide explicit information on the rights of the data subjects to rectify their inaccurate data (accuracy of data)."
35,Business,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy demonstrates compliance with several key GDPR principles. This includes the principle of lawfulness, as they state the legal basis for processing various types of data - for example, when using Maps, Camera, and Messaging apps. It also adheres to the principle of transparency, as it clearly outlines how data is collected, used, shared, and stored. The apps also abide by the principle of purpose limitation, mentioning that they collect and use different types of data specifically for features such as location-based suggestions, syncing across devices, and improving user experience. They have sections also describing data accuracy and storage limitation, allowing users to rectify or update their information and keeping track of your favorite places and recent map searches. Lastly, the policy insinuates integrity and confidentiality, mentioning that user data is secured and confidential. However, it might enhance the transparency principle by providing more detail or clarity on the security measures put in place to protect user data against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction, or damage."
36,Business,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of INFOLIFE LLC aligns greatly with GDPR Article 5 principles, thus indicating a good standard. The policy explicitly states the types of information collected by the organization, articulating a clear purpose for collecting each type of data, such as improving service quality and protecting user rights. This illustrates adherence to the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and purpose limitation. In addition, the firm has clear guidelines for information sharing, requiring user consent before sharing any personal data with third parties, thereby respecting the principle of fairness. The policy also provides details about the security measures in place, adhering to the principles of data integrity and confidentiality. The policy lacks clear details on data minimization, the time period for data retention (storage limitation), and how to maintain the accuracy of data, but overall, its alignment with several crucial GDPR standards indicates a good standard. However, they should strive to improve the policy further by addressing the missed principles."
37,Business,5M+,Bad Standard,"The content provided does not contain any information related to the processing of personal data, principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, or integrity and confidentiality. It is therefore impossible to assess its compliance with GDPR Article 5 principles."
38,Business,5M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy prominently outlines UKG’s commitment to protecting user data and offers a detailed description of their data collection, use, storage, and sharing practices. The policy clearly states the legal basis for processing data (such as legitimate interest or performance of a contract), complying with the principle of lawfulness. The policy also adheres to the principle of fairness, as it lays out UKG’s intent to process data without unjustly affecting the users. In line with the transparency principle, the policy uses clear and understandable language, specifying the types of personal information collected, the sources of this data, the purposes of data processing, and how the data may be disclosed. The policy’s commitment to purpose limitation is highlighted via their specific mentioning of the purposes for data usage. Data minimization is demonstrated with their policy only to “collect personal information necessary to fulfill the purpose(s)” for which the data was initially collected. Furthermore, they state that all information will be kept accurate, fulfilling the accuracy principle. They lay out their commitment to data security and the usage of various measures to protect user data, adhering to the principles of integrity and confidentiality. Finally, they state that data is retained only as long as necessary in accordance with the storage limitation principle. They also provide information on user rights regarding their data, in accordance with GDPR."
39,Business,5M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Microsoft for its Windows apps does follow certain good privacy policy standards such as transparency about how data is being used and stored, emphasis on data minimization, and the retention period of the data.
However, it lacks a clear basis for data processing. For example, in the section about the Maps app, it is mentioned that Microsoft may collect de-identified location data even when the app is not in use, but no clear legal basis is mentioned for this data processing.
Furthermore, the policy also falls short on ensuring accuracy of data. There are no explicit mechanisms in place that allow users to easily rectify or update their information.
Moreover, the policy fails to assure users of the integrity and confidentiality of their data in all aspects. While it presents some security measures such as the possibility to disable certain features, it lacks clear protocols for responding to data breaches.
Lastly, it is somewhat unclear on the issue of storage limitations. While the policy mentions that data will not be kept for longer than necessary, it does not provide clear criteria for determining the exact duration."
40,Business,10+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy demonstrates several key elements of good privacy policy standards outlined in GDPR Article 5 principles.
Specifically, it demonstrates transparency by clearly informing users about the information collection, its usage, handling to third-party companies, and the use of cookies. It also clearly states the purpose of data collection, such as ""providing and improving the Service"". This complies with the GDPR principles of transparency and purpose limitation.
Furthermore, the company outlines safeguards in place to protect the personal information of users, conforming to the data protection measures specified under the principles of integrity and confidentiality. They also have clear communication channels in place if there are any updates or changes to the privacy policy.
However, the policy could mention the data minimization principle by specifying that only necessary data is being collected and processed, and it could specify the storage duration of data to align with the GDPR's storage limitation principle."
41,Business,10+,Bad Standard,"The policy lacks sufficient transparency on types of personal data used and fails to clearly specify purposes for which this information is being collected and processed, thus violating the principles of transparency and purpose limitation. It only mentions that the information is for 'providing and improving the service' which is too vague. Moreover, the policy affirms that it uses third party services that may collect user data. However, it does not clearly mention any security measures taken to protect this data, thereby violating the principles of integrity and confidentiality. The policy also fails to specifically define the data retention period, missing the principle of storage limitation. The statement, 'we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it', is a clear indicator of the lack of explicit security measures to protect user data."
42,Business,10K+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy demonstrates a high degree of adherence to GDPR Article 5 principles, thus qualifying it as of a Good Standard.
Specific sections of this policy highlight its standard:
- Transparency is underlined throughout the policy. It clearly describes the information it collects, how it's used, and whom it's shared with. Multiple instances of clear language and communication make it easy to understand.
- Lawfulness and fairness are upheld as the policy outlines Mary Kay®'s legal basis for data processing under specific EU regulations. It gives details about their data-needs, ensuring processing doesn't unjustly affect the data subjects.
- Purpose limitation is strictly adhered to. The policy specifies the purposes for data collection and ensures it won't be used in unrelated ways (Wie verwenden wir diese Informationen? section)
- Adherence to the principle of data minimization is demonstrated by being explicit about what they collect, indicating they only collect necessary data.
- The policy also addresses storage limitation, ensuring data is kept only as long as necessary. It outlines the standards for data integrity and confidentiality (Sicherheit der Informationen section), showing they've taken measures to protect against unauthorized access and accidental loss.
- Rights of data subject are clearly explained under “Rechte betroffener Personen”. The policy shows respect towards maintaining accuracy by giving options to correct and update their information (Zugänglichkeit section).
It should be noted, however, that the policy may be improved with clearer language on how long data is stored and explicit details on the security measures employed."
43,Business,10K+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy adheres to the principles of transparency, data minimization, integrity and confidentiality, purpose limitations, accuracy, storage limitation and lawfulness.
- Transparency: The policy clearly outlines what personal data is collected, how it is used, and with whom it is shared (e.g. the organization / employer, other company users, vendors, and third-party service providers). It also notes how users can adjust their settings to control the data collection.
- Data minimization: The policy states that only necessary information is collected for the stated purposes, such as basic account information, content users post or share through the platform, and information about their device and usage of the platform.
- Purpose limitation: The policy strictly adheres to the data processing as defined by the agreement it has with the organization, limiting the usage of data strictly to fulfill its service to the organization.
- Accuracy: The policy allows users and organizations to access or correct their information on the platform, ensuring that everyone has the ability to maintain accurate personal data.
- Storage limitation: The policy clearly states that personal data is retained according to the organization's instructions, and that such data is deleted within 90 days once the contract with an organization is terminated.
- Integrity and confidentiality: It outlines the technical measures the company has implemented to ensure data protection and security, including an obligation to conduct information risk assessments, staff training, system administration, quality assurance, and measures to protect against data breaches.
- Lawfulness: The policy asserts that data processing activities are based on the lawful instructions from the organization or user's consent, fulfilling the principle of lawfulness. The policy also describes how the company will respond to lawful requests for data disclosure by public authorities.
- Clarity in handling GDPR compliances: This policy clearly outlines how it handles GDPR related compliances, how data is transferred internationally and making sure the appropriate safeguards are provided for data received from the EEA, UK and Switzerland. Procedures for dispute resolutions have also been outlined.
Overall, this policy is user-friendly and contains clear, comprehensive information about users' privacy rights and how their data is collected and used, making it a Good Standard privacy policy."
44,Business,10K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy adheres to the Good Standard and complies with GDPR principles due to several reasons. Primarily,
1. Lawfulness and Fairness: The policy has a clear legal basis as it states that by using the service, users agree to the collection and use of their data in line with the policy.
2. Transparency: The policy uses understandable language to explain what data is collected (such as email address, name, phone number, etc) and for what purposes (e.g., service provision, customer support, and technical issues prevention). It also mentions third-party service providers such as Google Analytics and Firebase and provides relevant details.
3. Purpose Limitation & Data Minimization: The purposes for data collection are precisely stated in the ""Use of Data"" section, ensuring that data will not be used in a manner incompatible with these purposes. They're collecting only necessary data.
4. Accuracy & Storage Limitation: While the policy does not directly address this standard, it provides contact details for any queries which can be used to rectify inaccurate data. However, the actual retention period is not stated, which could be improved.
5. Data Security and Integrity: The policy admits that while absolute security cannot be guaranteed, commercially acceptable means are being used to ensure the security of the user's data.
6. Confidentiality: The policy only allows service providers to access personal data for tasks and indicates that they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Although some areas can be detailed further, this policy satisfies the primary requirements for a Good Standard."
45,Business,10K+,Bad Standard,"The policy has several problematic areas. First, it doesn’t clearly state the purpose for collecting the described data, violating the Purpose Limitation principle. Secondly, it fails to provide details on data storage duration and data minimization practices. It collects hardware model, OS information, mobile network information, and device identifiers which seems to be more than necessary for analytics and doesn't justify this excess as required by the Data Minimization principle. Finally, while it does mention security, it doesn't specify any measures taken to ensure data protection, compromising the Integrity and Confidentiality principle of GDPR."
46,Business,10K+,Bad Standard,"This is a Bad Standard privacy policy. The reason is that while it references a privacy policy and mentions contact information as well as the right for users to access, correct, cancel, and object (ARCO rights), there is no specific information provided about the lawful basis for processing data, the type of data collected, purpose of collection, or how they ensure the data's accuracy and security. The policy is quite vague and does not adhere to transparency and data minimization principles. Additionally, there's no mention about storage duration of the data, which goes against the storage limitation principle."
47,Business,10K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy document of Oknet S.A. de C.V. exhibits adherence to the GDPR Article 5 principles. It transparently explains the collection of data via different methods, detailing specifics such as the types of data gathered. It puts forth the purposes for data collection, including identification purposes, promotional intentions, usage monitoring, quality evaluation, and client follow-ups, thereby complying with the principle of purpose limitation. Provisions for data minimization are visible in the defined intended uses, implying the collection of only necessary data. The document also highlights the importance the company places on data accuracy and provides a mechanism for users to update or rectify their data if required, corresponding to the principles of accuracy. It shows the company's practices towards storage limitation, discussing how data is kept in databases with limited access. Importantly, it explains the security measures in place to protect data from unauthorized use, loss, or damage, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. Users are also informed about their right to access, rectify, cancel, or contest their data, which is in alignment with GDPR requirements. Although it doesn't explicitly state the duration for which data will be kept, this doesn't necessarily make the privacy policy bad. However, the company could improve its standard by adding this detail. Overall, the document is clear, easily understandable, and not obscured by legal jargon, fulfilling the transparency requirement. Hence, it can be concluded that the privacy policy of Oknet S.A. de C.V. adheres to Good Standard. |"
48,Business,10K+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy does not provide any information about how it respects users' privacy rights, nor nor does it specify how it collects, uses, shares, and stores user data. It lacks information pertaining to the legal basis for processing user data, the measures used to protect user data, and how users can amend or delete their data. It also does not articulate its data minimization approaches nor the retention timeframe for user data. Thus, VetlinkPro's privacy policy is inadequate in terms of the GDPR Article 5 principles, rendering it a Bad Standard."
49,Business,10K+,Good Standard,"The policy demonstrates adherence to several key principles of good privacy policy standards. It allows for accuracy and rectification of data as users can update, correct or delete their information anytime and outlines a clear mechanism for consent and withdrawal of consent with regards to location information and mobile push notifications/alerts. This is shown in ""You may update, correct or delete information about you at any time..."" and ""When you first launch any...you can subsequently stop the collection..."". Furthermore, it respects user choices regarding cookies, as indicated by ""Most web browsers are set to accept cookies...you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies"". Lastly, it permits opting out of promotional emails as shown in ""You may opt out of receiving promotional emails DCI by following the instructions in those emails"".
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the complete policy is not available here for review, which means we cannot fully evaluate it against all the GDPR Article 5 principles such as lawfulness, transparency, purpose limitation, and data minimization."
50,Business,10K+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy of Backstitch Inc. fails to explicitly outline several aspects related to data privacy. It does not mention any legal basis for processing, which is a fundamental requirement for the principle of lawfulness. Furthermore, it does not provide any information on what kind of data is collected from users, how it will be used, shared, or stored, hence failing the principle of transparency. In addition, there is no evidence of purpose limitation or data minimisation as the policy does not specify the exact purposes for data collection or assure that it will collect only necessary data. There's no clear mention of how they ensure the accuracy of data and the duration for which the data is stored, thereby failing on the principles of accuracy and storage limitation. Finally, the policy does not outline the security measures implemented to protect user data, hence, it fails to ensure data integrity and confidentiality."
51,Business,10K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy document adheres to GDPR compliance standards of data collection and processing. It demonstrates transparency by explicitly stating the types of information collected and the purposes for collection - to improve services, communicate with users, and prevent fraud. The policy also highlights the user's right to request copies of their personal data, correct it, and even ask for their data to be deleted. The policy also safeguards children's information, stating that they do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. However, the policy does not particularly specify the period of data retention. Despite this minor shortcoming, the policy demonstrates a high level of adherence to the GDPR principles, thus justifying its classification as Good Standard."
52,Business,10K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy provided by Grupo Capistrano Alimentari S.A. de C.V. (""GCA"") adheres the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation and integrity, and confidentiality. The policy clearly defines its legal basis for data processing (user consent) and specifies the exact purposes for which the data will be collected such as for individualisation for product sales, billing, contact, and related commercial interactions all within legal and internal ""GCA"" guidelines. The policy also explains the principle of data minimization by stating that they only collect the necessary data for the stated purposes and no more. It also states that data will not be shared with third parties unless for fulfillment of obligations stated in legal documents with express user consent. It allows users to exercise their rights of access, rectification, cancellation, and opposition (A.R.C.O.) which demonstrates a commitment to ensure accuracy of data and respect consent of users. The policy also mandates that third parties will protect personal data under strict confidentiality. Finally, the policy states that GCA is committed to maintaining high levels of security, indicating a practice of integrity and confidentiality. Therefore, this privacy policy meets the definition of Good Standard."
53,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy demonstrates a commitment to several GDPR principles.
1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: The privacy policy provides a detailed and open clarity on how user data is collected and processed in each of the Microsoft apps. It discloses that user location information, typed texts, search history are collected and how they are used.
2. Purpose Limitation: The policy clearly outlines the specific purposes for data collection such as providing location-based suggestions, improving services, organization of photos and videos, and offering specific features to the users.
3. Data Minimization: While the policy outlines the collection of necessary user data such as location and search history, it doesn't specifically state that it limits the data collection to what is necessary. However, there is no evident excessive data collection beyond what is necessary for the stated purposes.
4. Accuracy: The policy does not directly mention how they ensure the accuracy of the data they collect but it allows users to change settings and preferences, indirectly giving users an opportunity to correct or update their information.
5. Storage Limitation: The policy mentions that user location and search history data would be stored when users sign in with their Microsoft account and this data will be synced across other devices and services. However, the policy fails to explicitly mention the duration of data storage.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: The policies explicitly detail the security measures they have in place, such as using secure (SSL) connection for transmitting user data, storage of user data in Microsoft servers, etc.
While it adheres to the standards in some fields, it falls short on explicitly discussing data minimization, accuracy, and storage duration, but not enough to classify it as a bad standard."
54,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Cisco demonstrates transparency by clearly stating that personal data may be transferred to various jurisdictions around the world including the United States of America. Moreover, their data processing activity's legal basis, which is presumably the consent of the users or some form of legal necessity, is highlighted by mentioning that users accepting these procedures. Furthermore, the policy demonstrates integrity and confidentiality by stating that they employ approved data transfer mechanisms and adhere to local legal requirements. Cisco uses several measures for data protection such as APEC Privacy Certification, EU Binding Corporate Rules, and EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. This illustrates a thorough commitment to protecting user data. Additionally, all this information is presented explicitly and understandably, fulfilling the principle of transparency. However, the policy does not provide detail on the purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, and storage limitation principles. Without information regarding these points, it is recommended for users to seek clarification on these matters."
55,Business,10M+,Bad Standard,"The policy does not explicitly state the legal basis for processing data, nor exactly what data is being collected and for what specific purposes - falling short of the lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and purpose limitation principles.

Finally, while the policy mentions they strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect the user’s personal information, they do not outline the specific technical and organizational measures in place - falling short of the integrity and confidentiality principle."
56,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of FX File Explorer meets the Good Standard criteria. The policy demonstrates fairness, lawfulness, and transparency in its data processing activities. It clearly states that it does not collect, send, or use any user information, which respects the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation. Furthermore, it assures users of data accuracy and storage limitation, stating that any authentication information is stored exclusively within the app and not transmitted elsewhere. Lastly, the privacy policy ensures data integrity and confidentiality by not sharing user data in any way other than for operations specifically requested by the user."
57,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy demonstrates compliance with several GDPR principles, which make it a Good Standard. It provides transparency and explains how user data is collected, used, and shared by various apps. For instance, the Maps app section states how location data is used and how users can disable access if desired. The Storage limitation principle is evident in the Messaging app section, where it talks about the storage of SMS/MMS messages and how to delete them. Furthermore, the policy addresses the principle of data minimization by only collecting necessary data for the functioning of the apps, such as location data for Maps and Camera apps. It also mentions the lawful basis for their data processing, as in the Narrator section where user data collected is used for product improvement. The policy also respects the principle of accuracy, as it provides mechanisms for users to rectify or manage their data, such as modifying which data is synced in the Mail and Calendar app. Lastly, the policy ensures data integrity and confidentiality by stating that the data collected is not shared with Microsoft or any third party without the users' consent, such as the voice data in Live captions. |"
58,Business,10M+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy lacks specificity in its explanation of data usage and storage. Section 1.2 and 2 enumerate data collection and possible uses but does not expressly state the purpose behind each type of data collected. Additionally, sections involving Jiguang SDK, BeiZi SDK, Topon SDK, Alipay SDK, and WeChat SDK indicate data sharing with third parties without explicit user consent, which fails the transparency aspect. Given the broad data collection scopes, data minimization might be in question as well. Lastly, there's no mention of data retention periods or security measures to protect user data, which is necessary under GDPR principles. |"
59,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy of Simple Scanner adheres to key principles of GDPR, including Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency, Purpose limitation, and Data minimization. It clearly mentions the legal basis for data processing (user consent), specifies the exact purposes for data collection (to scan documents and store data), and assures users of data minimization by only accessing certain necessary permissions. Furthermore, it demonstrates transparency about how the data is collected and used, providing clear and accessible information about their data processing activities. It notifies users about automatic uploading to cloud storage and the permissions required for this, which are strictly limited to the app's own files.
The policy also highlights the storage of data and how it will be handled, and ensures the Security of data during this process. It explicitly states that it will take ""reasonable measures to protect users personal information"" and the only reason for disclosure to third parties would be if it is required by law or agreed upon by user. This shows a commitment to maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, in line with GDPR principles.
Moreover, the privacy policy provides users with clear instructions about their consent and informs users about potential updates to the policy, further promoting transparency. It also provides a contact detail for privacy-related questions, ensuring that users have a mechanism for further inquiry.
However, it would be beneficial if the privacy policy included specific information regarding the time period for which the user's data will be stored, and how users can rectify or update their information. Notwithstanding, on the basis of the available information, the policy appears to adopt Good Privacy Policy Standards."
60,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy is mostly following the GDPR Article 5 principles. It detailed data collection and usage policies, asserted that personal data will not be used for purposes outside those explicitly stated in the policy, and did not report the collection of excessive personal data. It also specified the usage of permissions. The policy clarified that no data will be stored indefinitely and that any third-party services involved adhere to strong compliance standards. Additionally, the policy creator made the effort to assure users of security measures in place to protect their data. The policy encourages users to review it periodically for changes, reflecting transparency in the nature of the policy's potential evolution over time. Finally, the privacy policy ends with contact information for any concerns, core to a transparency-focused approach to data handling.
However, it's worth mentioning that the policy is notably weak in terms of allowing users to rectify their data, there is no mention of this point. Therefore, user ability to maintain data accuracy needs to be addressed, but as a whole, the policy abides by a greater majority of GDPR principles, hence the classification as 'Good'."
61,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy of CarrierX, LLC demonstrates a strong adherence to most of the GDPR Article 5 principles, hence its classification as a ""Good"" privacy policy.
To begin with, the policy provides clear information on the types of personal data it collects (name, email address, mailing address, payment information, social media account information etc). It further specifies the purposes for which these data are collected such as administering the user's account, processing payments, providing services, and improving the quality of the services. This clearly reflects the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and purpose limitation.
The policy also provides contact information for users who wish to access, correct, amend or delete their personal data, complying with the principle of accuracy.
Furthermore, it discloses its data sharing practices stating that it may share personal information with third-party vendors who help in service provision, and other subsidiary organizations. However, it commits to not trade, rent, or share personal information with unaffiliated third parties for independent marketing or use, unless required by law.
Lastly, the policy explains the measures taken to protect personal data in accordance with principles of integrity and confidentiality. Mention of deploying reasonable tech security measures and data encryption methodology shows the company's commitment to secure data processing.
However, it's worth noting the policy does not explicitly mention data retention periods or the standard of data minimization but on the whole the privacy policy demonstrates reasonably strong compliance with GDPR principles."
62,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy meets the Good Standard primarily because it adheres to the GDPR Article 5 principles. It demonstrates transparency and fairness by clearly stating how the user data is processed and the lawful reason for doing so – user consent. The purpose for data collection is clear and aligns with the purpose limitation, only required for functioning of premium features like Genius Cloud and debugging issues or for necessary services like customer help desk. They exhibit data minimization by not collecting unnecessary personal data, only required data like email address, password, IP address and device info for registration and syncing purposes are collected. They ensure data accuracy by allowing users to access, edit, delete, and export their data on their account. Storage limitation is addressed by specifying the retention period for different types of data like analytics data and crash logs. Lastly, they uphold the principles of data integrity and confidentiality by encrypting data during communication between different points and storage, not sharing data with third parties unless required by law, and mentioning specific security measures and subprocessors in place."

64,Business,10M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy outlines a clear and reasonable manner of data collection, which includes namess, addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and domain names. It also shows respect for the principle of fairness and transparency by providing clear instructions on how and when personal information will be collected. In alignment to the lawfulness, all the actions are legal and based on user's consent; furthermore, it provides an explanation on how the collected data will be used and shared, which includes improving the service, sharing with affiliated companies for certain purposes, and does not share or sell information to third parties without user’s permission, unless required by law, which adheres to the principles ofpurpose limitation and data minimization. Moreover, the policy includes an age limitation, which shows attention to protect children’s privacy, and highlights that the payment details will not be stored or even accessed by the company which is a clear sign of following data minimization principle. The policy also describes measures taken to ensure data security, which include maintaining strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards and limiting the access to the data only to those employees who need to process it, indicating a commitment to the principles of integrity and confidentiality. Lastly, it enables users to review and update their information, providing a mechanism to ensure the data's accuracy, and states that policy changes will be updated in the policy, upholding the transparency principle."
65,Business,50K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy presents a clear and explicit explanation of their data processing practices which follows the principles of lawfulness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality as defined by GDPR standards.
The policy outlines how data is collected, used, stored and shared. It also makes it clear that user information is kept updated and accurate, and encourages users to make necessary changes as needed (lawfulness and accuracy). There are also clear explanations on how they handle data processing for contactless payments and for their apps, showing data minimization and purpose limitation.
The policy mentions that certain methods, such as cookies, are used to collect data and users are provided with a link to another policy which likely provides more detail about cookie use (transparency). It additionally illustrates how user data may be shared with third parties and also that any data shared outside the EEA is subject to robust protection methods (integrity and confidentiality).
The policy clarifies that data is stored only for the duration necessary and explains user rights to the data collected (storage limitation).

It provides clear and transparent information about data collection, usage, and protection methods. The policy states a clear legal basis for data processing (necessary for the operation of the company), explains the purposes of data collection and processing (administrative, marketing, sales, and statistical purposes, among others), and respects the principle of data minimization by collecting only the necessary data for the stated purposes. Furthermore, it offers options for users to access, rectify, and erase their personal data. It also includes information on data security methods like the requirement of a digital certificate. The policy mentions the possibility of data transfer but specifically requires users' consent. Lastly, there is clear information on the right to revoke consent for data processing, providing instructions on how to proceed with such request. Nevertheless, users are advised to ensure they are comfortable with the company's practices as defined in the policy before giving their consent."

77,Business,100K+,Good Standard,"The policy provided presents a good standard of a privacy policy. It outlines clear justifications for data collection based on principles of lawfulness—including consent, contractual necessity, legitimate interest, and legal obligation. It is transparent about its practices, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for specific security and service delivery purposes. Furthermore, the policy explicitly informs individuals of their rights, the optional nature of data provision, and the implications of not providing requested information. The way they handle data aligns with the GDPR principles discussed above. However, it should be noted that the policy does not provide explicit information regarding storage limitation, data minimization, and specific security measures, which would otherwise strengthen its standard. The policy should be assessed in its complete context to ensure all areas are covered properly."
78,Business,100K+,Bad Standard,"The privacy policy lacks various key elements. It does not clearly state the legal basis for data processing, nor does it detail the specific purposes for which the data is collected. It does not mention how long the data will be stored, which might imply indefinite storage. While the policy discloses collection of personal and financial data, it does not assure users of the security measures employed to protect this data, compromising the principles of integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, there is no provision mentioned for the correction or updating of personal data. Finally, the language used is not easily understandable for an average user, which goes against the principle of transparency.

There is transparency in how data is collected, used, shared, and stored, providing clear and accessible information for the users (such as what personal information is collected, examples of automatic information collected, information from other sources, preferences the user can adjust, etc). It expresses the purpose of data collection explicitly for improving products and services, complying with the law, communication, advertisement, and fraud prevention. The principle of data minimization is reflected by allowing users to choose not to provide certain information, although it may limit their experience with IMDb Services. It addresses data accuracy by allowing users to update their information in account settings. The policy also outlines measures taken for data integrity and confidentiality, using encryption protocols and software for protection during transmission and maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. Lastly, IMDb's privacy policy respects the principle of storage limitation by only keeping prior versions of updated information for their records. All these points meet the Good Privacy Policy Standards as defined by the GDPR."

3. Purpose limitation: The policy asserts that the collected information is used to respond to user's requests for information or publications, which is a specified and explicit use.
4. Data minimization: The policy demonstrates restraint in data collection by stating it collects only what’s necessary for the stated purpose.
5. Data integrity and confidentiality: The organization does not sell, rent, or trade personal information, ensuring that personal data is handled responsibly.
However, the policy could be more explicit in detailing its strategies to ensure accuracy, the period of data retention (storage limitation), as well as security measures in place to protect user data."

Detailing on storage limitation, it assures users of the integrity and confidentiality of their data, outlining the security measures implemented to protect data against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. The policy also provides information on how users can access, review, and correct their personal information, and outlines specific rights for California residents in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act. Despite the amount of data being collected, the policy demonstrates necessity of this data in order to operate effectively because of the nature of the company's service, and it explicitly mentioned that the data is not being sold. The policy also discloses how data might be shared with legal and necessary third parties, again showcasing transparency. Lastly, it informs users of their responsibility for the safety and security of their data by not sharing their passwords. The overall presentation of the policy is clear and detailed which shows commitment towards maintaining good privacy practices.

87,Business,100K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy covers all principles that are required. It articulates responsibility and accountability in handling personal data, stating a designated Privacy Officer along with consistent security measures taken. The policy highlights a clear purpose for data collection, uses a transparent language, the user's consent is required for data collection, use or disclose, information is retained only until it is necessary, possible data breaches are attended to, there's specificity about the security measures being taken to protect personal data, data accuracy is also monitored and updated, and data minimization is indicated via the 'Limiting Collection' section. The policy furthermore ensures the confidentiality of the data mentioning the secure measures in place protecting the data from unlawful access.

Therefore, it cannot be considered a privacy policy."
89,Business,100M+,Good Standard,"This privacy policy document meets the Good Standard based on the GDPR Article 5 principles.
The document delivers particularly well on the principle of transparency. It informs users about the kind of information being collected, and why (e.g. location information being collected to improve Microsoft services). Clear information is given about how to change respective settings within each application to control data-sharing (e.g. disabling location services in Camera app).
The policy is comprehensive in outlining how each Windows application handles data, while adhering to the principle of purpose limitation. For example, the Mail and Calendar app only collects data necessary for providing the user with weather information and syncing account data.
Accurate data collection is ensured across applications with the ability to delete or change the data at any time, upholding the data accuracy principle. Additionally, the integrity and confidentiality of personal data are secured as most processing is performed on the user's device, or through secured connections (e.g., SSL).
However, better clarity could be provided regarding data storage durations to fully uphold the storage limitation principle, and reassure users of thorough compliance with all GDPR principles."
90,Business,100M+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy shows respect for the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality.

For example, it explains about how location data and search history are used in the Maps app, how location and other embedded data in photos/videos are handled in the Camera and Photos apps, and how contact and recent interaction data is managed in the People app. The policy also explains how users can manage their privacy settings. The policy appropriately addresses data minimization and accuracy by clarifying that services like Bing only collect necessary and relevant data. Also, the policy addresses storage limitation as it lets users know that they have the power to delete their backed-up messages and remove accounts at any time. Finally, the policy maintains data integrity and confidentiality by stating that they have security measures in place to protect the collected data and that certain data is processed on-device and is not shared with the cloud or Microsoft."

It also mentions user consent for the collection of specific types of data like facial recognition information. Measures for data security are highlighted and there are stipulations on data retention, along with contact information to exercise users' rights related to their personal data, which aligns with the GDPR principles. Also, Amazon makes it clear that they stand behind their promises and will not alter their policy to make it less protective without user consent, showing transparency and accountability. However, users should review the policy frequently for changes and updates. The policy also provides state-specific disclosures to meet regional legal obligations."
96,Business,500K+,Bad Standard,"| Bad | The privacy policy document here has several significant failings. Though it provides information about the types of data collected - including personally identifiable information and usage data - it does not clarify the legal basis for such data processing. Essentially, it fails to conform to the lawfulness principle. Moreover, the document does not state the specific data collection purposes, which contradicts the purpose limitation principle. Furthermore, the document permits an excessive amount of data collection without demonstrating its necessity for rendering the service, thus failing the data minimization criteria. Additionally, the document does not explain how long the data is stored or how users can update or rectify their data, disrupting both the storage limitation and accuracy standards. Lastly, it lacks information on the security measures in place to protect data, ignoring principles of integrity and confidentiality.|"

It exhibits fairness in not detrimental affecting users and transparency with clear explanations on data handling, including what is collected, how it's used, how long it's stored, and how it’s secured. Data minimization is shown through collecting only necessary data. Integrity and confidentiality are assured through robust security measures. However, there is room for improvement as the policy does not extensively detail how accuracy and storage limitation is ensured, and it would be beneficial to explicitly mention third-party data sharing rules. Overall, it's a reasonably solid policy with areas that could be better defined."
98,Business,500K+,Good Standard,"The privacy policy overall meets the requirements of a Good Standard.

It provides examples of the kind of personal data that may be collected. The policy explicitly states that users have control over the sharing of their data and that steps are taken to protect user data. It also mentions how it actively makes the personal information and content visible only to the private groups you are part of and provides an option to modify these settings. Thus, it has fairness, lawfulness, transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly mention the timeframe for which data is stored, but it does mention a 'recording subscription period,' which suggests some form of a time limitation.
